type etc', ', as also quantity of goods to be procured, should be clearly spelt out keeping in view the specific needs of the procuring organizations', ' The specifications so worked out should meet the basic needs of the organization without including superfluous and non-essential features, which may result in unwarranted expenditure', ' Care should also be taken to avoid purchasing quantities in excess of requirement to avoid inventory carrying costs;\\n\\noffers should be invited following a fair, transparent and reasonable procedure;\\n\\nthe procuring authority should be satisfied that the selected offer adequately meets the requirement in all respects;\\n\\nthe procuring authority should satisfy itself that the price of the selected offer is reasonable and consistent with the quality required;\\n\\nat each stage of procurement the concerned procuring authority must place on record, in precise terms, the considerations which weighed with it while taking the procurement decision', '\\n\\nChannels of Procurement: Procurement of stores will in general be done by one of the following methods:\\n\\nPlacing\\tdemands\\ton\\tthe\\tDirector\\tGeneral\\tof\\tOrdnance

reasons it is necessary to procure lesser quantities', ' Care should also be taken not to purchase stores much in advance of actual requirements, if such purchase is likely to prove unprofitable to the Government, and thus locking up of capital in stock should be minimized', '\\n\\nScales: Where scales of consumption or limits of stores have been laid down by the competent authority, the officer ordering a supply should certify on the purchase order/demands that the prescribed scales or limits are not exceeded', '\\n\\nSplitting: Purchase order should not be split to avoid the necessity for

'2', '9 of this Manual, provided it does not entail any delay in procurement, defeating the very purpose of procurement', '\\n\\nIf the firm is not found to be technically compliant, further cognizance of the tender need not be taken and the firm advised accordingly, with the advice to apply separately for registration', '\\n\\nIn a single bid tender, the tender may be considered if it does not involve any trials or does not result in delay in procurement', '\\n\\nSingle Tender Enquiry (STE)\\n\\nSingle Tender Enquiry (STE): Procurement from a single source may be resorted to with the prior approval of the CFA and in consultation with the IFA, where required as per delegation of financial powers for reasons to be recorded in writing in the following circumstances, after determining reasonableness of the rates:\\n\\n\\nIn a case of emergency/urgency, the required goods are necessarily to be purchased from a particular source', '\\n\\nOn account of any other operational or technical requirement, which should, however, be clearly recorded', '\\n\\n\\tReasons for recommending procurement on STE: Wherever applicable, the Indentor should communicate to the Procuring Agency the reasons for recommending STE', '\\n\\nSTE to be sent only to OEMs and registered firms: STE should generally be sent to the OEM or to a registered firm', '\\n\\nProcurement on the basis of the Proprietary Article Certificate (PAC)\\n\\nPAC Tendering: Certain items, particularly equipments, are the propriety product of a manufacturing firm', ' Such items are only available with that firm or their dealers, stockists or distributors as the detailed specifications are not available for others to manufacture the item', ' Situations may also arise when, for standardization of machinery or ensuring compatibility of spare parts with the existing sets of equipment, as per the advice of the competent technical expert, goods and services have to be obtained from a particular source', ' In such situations, a Propriety Article Certificate (PAC) may be issued to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and items procured on PAC basis from that particular firm or its authorized dealers, stockists or distributors', ' While PAC is issued only in respect of the concerned OEM, the item may be bought from any dealer, stockist or distributor specified in that particular PAC on the basis of the information provided by the OEM, provided the purchase is accompanied by a proper manufacturer certification', ' PAC once issued will be valid for two years from the date of issue unless cancelled earlier by the CFA', '\\n\\nRepairs/servicing on the basis of PAC: The provisions of paragraph\\n4', '5', '1 would also apply to repairs and servicing of equipment through the sole dealer/servicing agency, authorized by the OEM, if the main equipment was purchased on the basis of PAC', '\\n\\n\\tCaution to be exercised while granting PAC: PAC bestows monopoly and obviates competition', ' Hence, PAC status must be granted after careful consideration of all factors like fitness, availability, standardization and value for money', ' Many OEMs do not manufacture assemblies, sub- assemblies and components but outsource these items', ' Hence, such items may be available at cheaper prices with the actual manufacturers', ' The procurement officers must, therefore, keep abreast of the proper source knowledge and procure items from the right source to protect the interest of the State', ' However, the spares have to be sourced from OEM\\n\\n\\nor OEM approved/recommended manufacturers only in order to make the OEM responsible for the malfunctioning of the main equipment in which the spares have been fitted', '\\n\\nThe PAC Certificate should be as per the following format', '\\n\\nProprietary Article Certificate\\n\\n(Description of Goods/services):   \\t                                                     It is certified that:\\nThe\\tgoods\\tare\\tmanufactured/services\\tare\\tprovided\\tby\\n\\n…………………………', '', '', ' (name of the OEM)\\n\\nNo other make or model/service provider is acceptable for the following

vide………………………', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSingle and Two Bid Systems\\n(Signature with date and designation of the Officer signing the PAC)\\n\\nSingle Bid system: For stores available commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) and LP items, where qualitative requirements and technical specifications are clear, single commercial bid system may be followed', ' This system may also be followed for other procurements of non-complex nature', ' No sample should be called for in single bid system at the RFP stage', '\\n\\n\\nTwo bid system: For purchasing high value plant, machinery, equipment, IT and communication systems and for turnkey projects, etc', ', which are of a complex and technical nature or for procurement of items which have indeterminable parameters, such as shade, tone, make-up, feel, finish and workmanship, etc', ', bids should normally be obtained in two parts as follows:\\n\\nTechnical bid consisting of all technical details along with commercial terms and conditions; and\\n\\nFinancial bid indicating item-wise price for the items mentioned in the technical bid and all other commercial terms and conditions', '\\n\\nDescription of the user requirement: The RFP should lay down user requirements in a comprehensive, structured and concrete manner and should be broad based', ' The user requirements should be expressed in terms of functional characteristics', ' Its formulation must not prejudice the technical choices by being narrow and tailor-made', ' Specific Quality Assurance requirements, if any, should be included in the RFP', '\\n\\n\\tManner of submission of bids in two bid system: The technical bid and the financial bid should be sealed by the bidder in separate covers duly superscribed and both these sealed covers are to be put in a bigger cover which should also be sealed and duly superscribed', ' The technical bids are to be opened and evaluated in the first instance', ' At the second stage, financial bids of only the technically acceptable offers should be opened for further evaluation and ranking before awarding the contract', '\\n\\nPerformance parameters: The performance parameters should be verifiable and provide for the minimum essential military requirements', ' Fulfillment of essential parameters mentioned in the RFP would be the basis for further consideration by TEC (Technical Evaluation Committee)', '\\n\\nCost of Tender and Bid Security/Earnest Money Deposit\\n\\n\\tThe cost of the Tender document: Tender sets in respect of Advertised (Open) Tender Enquiry will be sold on payment of the prescribed price given below', '\\n\\n Estimated value of the Tender Price of the Tender set (Rs)  1 Upto Rs 50 lakhs 100  2 More than Rs 50 lakhs but upto Rs 1 crore 250  3 More than Rs 1 crore but upto Rs 5 crores 500  4 More than Rs 5 crores 1,000  \\n\\nNote: Cost of drawings and specifications will be extra', ' This may be decided in consultation with integrated finance at the time of issuing the RFP', '\\n\\nBid security: To safeguard against a bidder’s withdrawing or altering his bid during the bid validity period in the case of advertised or limited tender enquiry, Bid Security (also known as Earnest Money Deposit) is to be obtained from the bidders', ' The bidders should be asked to furnish the bid security along with their bids', '\\n\\nAmount of Bid Security: Amount of bid security should ordinarily range between two percent to five percent of the estimated value of the goods to be procured', ' The exact amount of bid security should be determined judiciously while processing the proposal for CFA’s approval and indicated in the RFP', \"\\n\\nForm of Bid Security: The bid security may be accepted in the form of Account Payee Demand Draft, Fixed Deposit Receipt, Banker's Cheque or Bank Guarantee from any of the public sector banks or a private sector bank authorized to conduct government business, as per Form DPM-13, safeguarding the purchaser's interest in all respects\", '\\n\\nValidity of the Bid Security: The bid security is normally to remain valid for a period of forty-five days beyond the final bid validity period', '\\n\\nRefund of Bid Security of Bidders: Bid securities of the unsuccessful bidders should be returned to them at the earliest after expiry of the final bid validity and latest on or before the 30th day after the award of the contract', ' The Bid Security of the successful bidders should be returned, without any interest whatsoever, after the receipt of Performance Security from them as called for in the contract', '\\n\\nExemption from Submission of Bid Security: Bid security is not required to be obtained from those firms who are registered with the Central Purchase Organization (e', 'g', ' DGS&D), National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) or concerned Departments or Ministries of the Government of India', ' Bid security need not be asked for if the value of the tender is Rs two lakh or less', '\\n\\nForfeiture of the Bid Security: The bid security/earnest money will be liable to be forfeited if the bidder withdraws or amends, impairs or derogates from the tender in any respect within the validity period of his tender', ' No separate order is required for forfeiture of Bid Security which follows on default and should be credited at once to the Government Account', '\\n\\n\\nTendering Process\\n\\nExpression of Interest: In those cases where specifications of the desired goods or services are not clear or the sources are not known and it is considered desirable to resort to pre-qualification of suppliers, a notice calling for expression of interest/information may be issued and pre-bid conference may be held with the firms which fulfill the criteria prescribed in the notice to firm up the Qualitative Requirements (QRs)/specifications before issuing the Request for Proposal', '\\n\\nPreparation of the Request for Proposal/Tender Enquiry: The Request for Proposal (RFP), also called Tender Enquiry (TE), is the most important document in the procurement process', ' The RFP should be prepared with due care and with complete details of the items or services required, terms and conditions including payment terms, and clear instructions to the bidders', ' The RFP should contain full and clear specifications, scope of requirement and the evaluation criteria, both for technical bids and commercial bids', ' RFP should be vetted by integrated finance in those cases where financial powers are to be exercised with their concurrence', ' The provisions of paragraph 4', '6', '3 of this Manual should be kept in mind while specifying the user requirements', '\\n\\nReference to Brand Names in the RFP: Standards and specification, quoted in bidding documents in generic terms shall promote the broadest possible competition while assuring the critical performance or fulfillment of other requirements for the goods', ' Reference to the brand names, catalogue numbers, etc', ' in the RFP should be avoided', '\\n\\nFormat of RFP: The suggested format for the RFP for indigenous procurement of goods and services as defined in Chapter 1 of this Manual is given at Appendix ‘C’', ' The specimen format is based on various instructions contained in this Manual and, therefore, it should generally not be changed, except for minor changes relating to the text to suit the requirement of a specific proposal or deletion of clauses that may not be applicable in a particular case', ' It must be borne in mind that no clause should be incorporated in the contract/supply order if it was not mentioned in the RFP as inclusion of clauses in the contract which did not figure in the RFP would amount to unfair denial of opportunity to other suppliers', '\\n\\nReceipt of tenders\\n\\n\\tTender Box: In order to ensure that the bids are received by the purchaser in time, a tender box is to be placed in an easily accessible but secured place, duly locked and sealed, clearly indicating the name of the department', ' The words “Tender Box” should be written on the box in bold font', '\\n\\n\\nDelivery of Bids by Hand: In cases where the tenders are required to be submitted by hand, it may be ensured that the names and designation of at least two officers are mentioned in the bid documents', ' The information about these officers should also be displayed at the entrance reception of the premises where tenders are to be deposited so as to ensure convenient approach for the bidders', '\\n\\nAmendment to the RFP and Extension of Tender Opening Date\\n\\n\\tAmendment to the RFP: Sometimes situations may arise necessitating modification of the tender documents already issued (in Limited Tender Enquiry cases) or already put on sale (in Advertised/Open Tender Enquiry cases) due to change in the required quantity or specifications', ' In some cases, after receiving the documents, a tenderer may point out some genuine mistakes necessitating amendment in the tender documents', ' In such situations, it may become necessary to amend/modify the tender documents suitably prior to the date of submission of bids', ' Copies of such amendment/ modification should be simultaneously sent to all the selected suppliers by registered/speed post/ courier/e-mail in case of Limited Tender Enquiry', ' In case of Advertised/Open Tender Enquiry, copies of such amendments/ modifications should be dispatched simultaneously free of cost by registered/speed post/courier/e-mail to all the parties who may have already purchased the tender documents and copies of such amendments are also required to be prominently attached to the unsold tender documents (which are available for sale), including the tender documents put on the website', '\\n\\nWhen the amendment/modification changes the requirement significantly and/or when there is not much time left for the tenderers to respond to such amendments, and prepare revised tender, the time and date of submission of tenders are also to be extended suitably, along with suitable changes in the corresponding time-frames for receipt of tender, tender validity period etc and validity period of the corresponding EMD/Bid security', ' Depending on the situation, such an amendment may also need fresh publication adopting the same procedure as for publication of the original tender enquiry', '\\n\\n\\tExtension of Tender Opening Date: Even in those cases where extension of tender opening date does not become necessary because of the amendment to the RFP, the Competent Financial Authority, with the concurrence of integrated finance, where required as per delegation of financial powders, may extend the date of opening of the tender as specified in the RFP but such extension should not exceed the total delivery period envisaged in the RFP', ' Any further extension would require approval of the next higher CFA', ' Such extensions and amendments should be published in the same journals/newspapers in which the original\\n\\n\\nRFP was published and must be given publicity through the website if the original RFP was hosted on the website', '\\n\\n\\tExtension of Tender Opening Date After Due Date of Opening: In exceptional circumstances, date of opening of the tender may be extended within a reasonable period after the due date of the opening of tenders for reasons to be recorded in writing, with the approval of the higher CFA and in consultation with the IFA, where financial powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance', '\\n\\nTender Opening\\n\\n\\tOpening of Tenders Under Single Bid System: The following procedure should be followed for opening of tenders:\\n\\nAll the tenders received on time should be opened in the presence of authorized representatives of the tenderers at the prescribed time, date and place by the official/Tender Opening Committee, to be nominated by the CFA in advance', ' The authorized representatives, who intend to attend the tender opening, would be required to bring with them letters of authority from the tenderers concerned', '\\n\\nThe tender opening official/committee should announce the salient features of the tenders like description and specification of the goods, quoted price, terms of delivery, delivery period, discount if any, whether EMD furnished or not and any other special feature of the tender for the information of the representatives attending the tender opening', '\\n\\nAfter opening, every tender should be numbered serially, initialed, and dated on the first page by the official(s) authorized to open the tenders', ' Each page of the price schedule or letter attached to it shall also be initialed by them with date, particularly the prices, delivery period etc', ', which should also be circled and initialed indicating the date', ' Blank tenders, if any, should be marked accordingly by the tender opening officials', '\\n\\nAlterations in tenders, if any, made by the tenderers, should be initialed with date and time by the official(s) opening the tenders to make it perfectly clear that such alterations were present on the tenders at the time of opening', '\\n\\nWherever any erasing or cutting is observed, the substituted words should also be encircled and initialed with date and time to make clear that such erasing/cutting of the original entry was present on the tender at the time of opening', '\\n\\n\\nThe tender opening official(s) should prepare a list of the representatives attending the tender opening and obtain their signatures on the list', ' The list should contain the representatives’ names and the corresponding tenderers’ names and addresses', ' The authority letters brought by the representatives should be attached with this list', ' This list should be signed by both the tender opening official(s) with date and time', '\\n\\nAn on-the-spot report containing the names of the tenderers (serial number wise) salient features of the tenders, as read out during public opening of tenders should be prepared by the tender opening official(s) duly signed by them with date and time', '\\n\\nThe tenders, which have been opened, the list of the representatives attending the tender opening and the on-the spot report should be handed over to the nominated officer of the procuring agency and acknowledgement obtained for the same', '\\n\\nOpening of tenders under two bid system: The procedure laid down in the preceding paragraph should be followed mutatis mutandis under two bid system also but only the technical bids should be opened in the first instance', ' Commercial bids of only QR-compliant tenderers should be opened only after evaluation of the technical bids and approval of the TEC report by the CFA', ' The commercial bids of other tenderers, who are not found to comply with the QRs as above, will be returned to the tenderers, in sealed and unopened condition as received', '\\n\\nEvaluation of Technical Bids\\n\\n\\tOpening of Technical Bids: Where quotations are invited as separate technical and commercial bids, initially only the technical bids are to be opened in the presence of the tenderers or their duly authorized representatives', '\\n\\n\\tEvaluation of Technical Bids: After opening of the technical bids, technical evaluation is to be carried by a duly appointed Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC)', '\\n\\n\\tTechnical Evaluation Committee (TEC): TEC, wherever formed, should invariably have representatives of the user, designated inspecting agency, maintenance agency, procurement agency and CFA, apart from the Chairman', ' Finance representative need not be associated with the TEC', '\\n\\n\\tObjective of the TEC: The main objective of the TEC is to prepare technical matrix showing how the technical parameters of bids received compare with the parameters mentioned in the tender document/RFP', ' If the offers conform to essential parameters they should be accepted', '\\n\\n\\n\\nPreparation of Compliance Report by TEC: The TEC should prepare a compliance statement bringing out the extent of variations and differences, if any, in the technical characteristics of the equipment/ tendered item(s) offered by various vendors with reference to QRs and compliance or non- compliance with the essential parameters', ' If considered necessary, the TEC may invite those vendors who meet essential parameters for technical presentation/clarification', '\\n\\n\\tFormat of the TEC Report: The TEC report should be prepared in the format as given at Form DPM-24', ' The following aspects should be kept in mind by the TEC:\\n\\nThe basic profile/character of technical offer must not be permitted to be changed', '\\n\\nOpportunity for revision of minor technical details should be accorded to all vendors in equal measure to ensure fair play', '\\n\\nNo extra time should be given to any vendor to modify his offer to make it QR compliant', '\\n\\nOriginal commercial quotes must remain firm and fixed and no loading/unloading in price should be permitted during TEC’s discussion with the vendor', '\\n\\nNo conditional offer should be accepted which is not in conformity with the specifications mentioned in the RFP', '\\n\\nMandate of the TEC as regards commercial aspects: The TEC is not authorized to discuss commercial aspects of the case', ' However, the TEC should prepare a compliance statement in respect of commercial terms and conditions, such as bid security, warranty, etc', ', included in the technical bid as per the RFP', '\\n\\n\\tAssociation of IFA: Whenever two bid system of tendering is followed, technical evaluation of the bid becomes a vital step not only for ascertaining conformity of the technical bids with the technical specifications mentioned in the tender, but also to bring all bidders on a level playing field in respect of qualitative requirements', ' While technical evaluation is to be carried out by the TEC and integrated finance need not be associated at this stage, CFA may, if considered necessary, evolve a system of associating the IFA or his representative in examination of the\\n\\n\\nTEC Report in regard to compliance with the commercial terms and conditions before opening of the price bid', ' TEC report, once finalized, should be sent to CFA for acceptance', '\\n\\n\\tApproval by the CFA: The TEC report should be approved by the respective CFA', ' TEC report may be accepted by Defence Secretary and Special/Additional Secretary in those cases where Raksha Mantri and Defence Secretary respectively are the CFAs', '\\n\\nQR-compliant Offers: Those offers which meet the essential parameters as per the TEC report, duly approved by the CFA, should be considered by the Commercial Negotiation Committee (CNC) which, in turn, should evolve methods for benchmarking of price and holding internal meetings to finalize approach for conducting negotiations with the L1 vendor, if considered necessary by the CFA, in consultation with the IFA where powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance', '\\n\\nRevised Commercial Bids in Two Bid System: In case of procurement involving two-bid system, it may not be practicable to incorporate all possible details in the technical specification(s), thereby requiring elaborations/clarifications during technical discussion', ' This may necessitate submission of revised commercial bids consequent upon discussion during TEC/CNC', ' If the original price bids have not been opened, it would be advisable to give equal opportunity to all technically acceptable vendors to give their revised commercial bids in a sealed cover', ' The CNC would take into account the revised commercial bids to arrive at L1', '\\n\\nCFA’s Approval for Obtaining Revised Commercial Bids: Before calling for revised commercial bids where original price bids have not been opened, approval of CFA should invariably be taken, after consulting integrated finance, where required as per delegation of financial powers', ' It is absolutely essential to give equal opportunity to all qualified vendors', '\\n\\nEvaluation of Commercial Bids\\n\\n\\tPreparation of the Comparative Statement of Tenders: After opening of the commercial bids (of QR-compliant tenderers in the case of two bid system and after approval of the TEC report by the CFA), the procuring agency should prepare a comparative statement of tenders (CST)', ' The comparative statement of tenders should be prepared with due care showing each element of cost (basic cost, taxes, levies, etc', ') separately against each tenderer', ' The CST should be prepared soon after opening of the commercial bids and got vetted by the IFA as to its correctness, where\\n\\n\\nfinancial powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance', '\\n\\n\\tCommercial Evaluation: Evaluation of commercial bids is the core activity in any purchase decision', ' If the correct evaluation of quoted rates, freight, insurance, taxes, duties and other expenses involved is not carried out as per the criteria incorporated in the RFP, purchase decision may become deficient and faulty', ' Detailed guidelines on establishing reasonability of prices and ranking of bids are contained in Chapter 13 of this Manual', '\\n\\n\\tCommercial Negotiations: It is not mandatory to hold commercial negotiations in each case, particularly in open and limited tender cases, where the response has been substantial and the L1 price is found to be very close to the reasonable price, if such an assessment had been carried out prior to opening of the commercial bids', ' However, commercial negotiation may become necessary to ensure that the interest of the State is fully protected and the price paid is reasonable', ' Commercial negotiations are invariably conducted in case of single tender situations, including PAC cases, or when price is considered high with reference to assessed reasonable price, irrespective of the nature of tendering', ' Such negotiations are invariably conducted by a duly appointed Commercial Negotiation Committee (CNC), which should invariably include a finance member, unless the negotiation is carried out by the committee CFA itself', '\\n\\n\\tComposition of CNC: Apart from the Chairman, there should be representatives of the User, Integrated Finance, designated Inspecting Agency, Maintenance Agency, Directorate concerned with post-contract management and the CFA, wherever applicable', ' CFA may nominate any other member, like a costing expert, in case of high value single vendor offers while constituting the CNC', '\\n\\nChairman of the CNC: The CNC may be headed by an officer one rank below that of the CFA', ' The CNC may be headed by a Joint Secretary where Raksha Mantri or Defence Secretary is the CFA', ' The CFAs in the Ministry of Defence may also authorize an officer from the Services Headquarters to be the chairman of a CNC, particularly in those cases where the proposal was initially processed under the delegated powers but on opening of the tenders the cost was found to have exceeded the financial powers delegated to the CFAs in the Services Headquarters', '\\n\\nPrice Reasonableness: The basic objective of the CNC is to establish reasonableness of price being paid by the Government', ' This is a complex task and  many  factors need  to  be  considered', ' Detailed  guidelines  are\\n\\n\\ncontained in Chapter 13 of this manual', ' However, factors like the last purchase price (LPP), movement of price indices, the market intelligence regarding cost of the item or similar items, material composition, cost analysis of raw materials, technological complexities involved, whether the items are of current production or otherwise, maintenance requirements, requirement of spares and warrantee etc', ' need to be considered while examining price reasonableness', '\\n\\n\\tResponsibility of the CNC: Wherever negotiations are conducted by the CNC, minutes of the CNC meetings should be recorded clearly and expeditiously', ' CNC should determine L1 and make unambiguous and specific recommendations giving reasons for making the recommendations', ' Detailed record of discussions regarding compliance with tendered QRs, price and contract clauses held during the CNC should be prepared and placed on record in the form of minutes of the meeting', ' All the members of the CNC should sign the minutes', '\\n\\nAcceptance of CNC’s recommendations: The recommendations of the CNC should be processed on file by the Procuring Agency for the approval of the CFA with the concurrence of the IFA, wherever required as per the delegation of powers', '\\n\\nLack of Competition\\n\\n\\tLack of competition', ' The following situations would imply lack of competition:\\n\\nThe number of acceptable offers is less than two', '\\n\\nRing prices have been quoted by all tenderers (Cartel formation)', '\\n\\nThe product of only one manufacturer has been offered by all the tenderers irrespective of the number of quotations', '\\n\\nStore under purchase is chronically in short supply against which the number of acceptable offers never exceeds two', '\\n\\nResultant Single Vendor Situation\\n\\nAction to be Taken in Resultant Single Vendor Situations: There are cases when only a single quote or a single valid acceptable quote is received even against LTE or OTE', ' This situation may arise in single bid tendering as well as in two-bid tendering before or after technical evaluation', ' This results in a single vendor situation indicating lack of competition', ' In such situations, the following aspects will be examined:\\n\\n\\nWhether all necessary requirements such as standard tender enquiry conditions, industry-friendly specifications, wide publicity, sufficient time for formulation of tenders had been taken care of while issuing the RFP;\\n\\nWhether the RFP had been properly dispatched and duly received by the prospective vendors to whom these were sent', '\\n\\nWhether the SQRs, particularly in the LTE cases, could be reformulated and made more broad based to generate wider competition', '\\n\\nWhether time and criticality of requirement permits reformulation of the SQRs', '\\n\\nIf the examination reveals that (a) and (b) had been complied with and (c) an (d) are not feasible, the proposal may be processed further treating it as a case of OTE or LTE as the case may be with the approval of the CFA', ' In case, however, there is any doubt about the tendering process or it is considered feasible to consider reformulation of SQRs without compromising on operational requirement, the RFP should be retracted and re-issued after rectifying the deficiencies and/or reformulating the SQRs', '\\n\\nRe-tendering\\n\\n\\tRe-tendering: Re-tendering may be recommended by the CNC and approved by the CFA with the concurrence of integrated finance, where original sanction was accorded with the concurrence of integrated finance, with utmost caution, generally under the following circumstances:\\n\\nOffer(s) do not conform to qualitative requirements and other terms and conditions set out in the RFP', '\\n\\nThere are major changes in specifications and quantity, which may have considerable impact on the price', '\\n\\nPrices quoted are unreasonably high with reference to assessed reasonable price or there is evidence of a sudden slump in prices after receipt of the bids', '\\n\\nWhere there is lack of competition and there are clear and reasonable grounds to believe that the lack of competition was due to restrictive specifications, which did not permit many vendors to participate', ' In such cases, which should, however, be rare as the specifications should normally be formulated with due care and after pre-bid conference, wherever required, CFA should consider if there is a\\n\\n\\npossibility of reviewing the specifications to facilitate wider and adequate competition', '\\n\\n\\tWithdrawal of offer by L1: In case the lowest tenderer withdraws his offer, re-tendering should be resorted to as per the instructions issued by the Central Vigilance Commission', ' While retendering RFP may not be issued to the vendor who had backed out and EMD, if any, of such a firm should be forfeited', '\\n\\n\\tProcurement of bare minimum quantity in case of re-tendering: In cases where it is decided to resort to re-tendering due to unreasonableness of the quoted rates but the requirement is urgent/inescapable and re-tendering for the entire quantity is likely to delay the availability of the item(s) jeopardizing the essential operations, maintenance and safety, negotiation may be held with the L1 bidder for supply of a bare minimum quantity', ' The balance quantity should, however, be procured expeditiously through re-tender, following the normal tendering process', '\\n\\nSigning of Contract/Placing of Supply Order\\n\\n\\tSigning of Contracts/Placing of Supply Orders: Once the CNC recommendations are accepted by the CFA or approval accorded by the CFA in those cases in which no CNC is held, the contract should be signed or the supply order placed, as the case may be, immediately', ' It must be ensured that the contract/supply order is as per the approved terms and conditions and the rates are correctly shown as finally negotiated and accepted by the CFA', ' Contracts/supply orders should be vetted by the IFA, wherever required as per delegation of financial powers, prior to acceptance of the purchase proposal by the CFA', ' Copies of the contract/supply order should be sent to all concerned, including the IFA, the audit authority and the paying authority, and their acknowledgement obtained', ' The format for Contract and Supply Order is given in Appendix E and D respectively', '\\n\\nCartel Formation / Pool Rates\\n\\n\\tCartel Formation/Pool Rates: Sometimes a group of tenderers quote identical rates against a rate contract tender', ' Such Pool/Cartel formation is against the basic principle of competitive bidding and defeats the very purpose of open and competitive tendering system', ' Such practices should be severely discouraged with strong measures', ' Suitable administrative actions like rejecting the offers, reporting the matter to Registrar of Companies, MRTP Commission, National Small Industries Corporation etc', ' should be initiated against such firms, on case to case basis, as decided by the competent authority', ' Ministries/ Departments may also\\n\\n\\nexamine the desirability of bringing such unhealthy practice to the notice of the concerned trade associations like FICCI, ASOCHAM, NSIC, etc', ' requesting them, inter alia, to take suitable strong action against such firms', ' New firms should also be encouraged to get themselves registered for the subject goods/services to break the monopolistic attitude of the firms forming cartels', ' All requests for making reference to outside agencies, such as Registrar of Companies or trade associations, are to be made to the Ministry of Defence', '\\n\\nProcedure to be Followed for Procurement of Stores Involving Validation/Testing\\n\\n\\tCircumstances in Which the Procedure is to be Followed: Due to constant changes in technology, various weapons, equipments, ammunition, etc', ', which are already in service, need to be replaced by newer variants or upgraded/refurbished/re-equipped/modified/ overhauled to incorporate advancements in technology', ' This may necessitate validation trials/testing of upgraded/refurbished/re-equipped/modified equipment, if considered necessary by the Service Headquarters concerned', ' The procedure set out in this paragraph would be applicable to cases processed at the level of the Ministry of Defence/Service Headquarters only and should be suitably indicated while seeking AON', ' Such cases will not be treated as new introduction into Service', '\\n\\nCategories of Cases: The cases to be processed under the provisions of this paragraph would generally fall into the following category:\\n\\nProcurement of upgraded new versions of equipment, ammunition, vehicles, etc', ', which are classified as stores that can be procured from the revenue head, provided these conform to the existing laid down QRs and meet the prescribed performance parameters or certain enhanced parameters which have been incorporated as an amendment to the existing QRs', '\\n\\nUpgradation, refurbishment, re-equipment, modification, Technical Life Extension, Overhaul, etc', ' of weapon platforms/systems/aggregates which can be carried out under the provisions of this Manual and as per the existing orders', ' The upgradation, refurbishment, re-equipment, modification, overhaul, etc', ' may be carried out at OEM’s premises abroad or in India, or partially in India and partially at OEM’s premises abroad, or even at a venue such as a Repair Overhaul Plant (ROH) where the requisite facilities are available, which may neither be in India nor at the OEM’s premises, provided it is certified by the OEM as having the technical capacity/capability', '\\n\\nProcedure to be Followed for Procurement of Stores: For procurement of items mentioned in paragraph 4', '19', '2 (a) above, the Service\\n\\n\\nHeadquarters should decide whether a validation process would be required and, if so, it should be indicated in the proposal', ' If such validation process (trial/testing) is considered necessary, the scope and duration thereof should also be finalized and indicated in the RFP', ' It should be mentioned in the RFP that the vendors which are found technically compliant would be required to provide specified quantities of the item on ‘no-commitment-no-cost’ basis for trial evaluation/testing', ' The period within which the Vendor must submit the equipment/sample after being found technically complaint must be indicated in the RFP', ' The Technical evaluation will be a two-stage process', ' After the technical bids are opened, the TEC will short-list the vendors, which are technically compliant, and the TEC Report will be approved by the CFA', ' Thereafter, the technically compliant vendors will go through the process of evaluation/testing', ' The evaluation/testing should ideally be completed within a period not exceeding eight months from receipt of the equipment/sample from the vendors', ' The Validation Trial/Testing report will be again ratified by the TEC and approved by the CFA', '\\n\\nOpening of Commercial Offer After Trial Evaluation/Testing: The commercial offer should be opened only after acceptance of the TEC/ Validation Trial/Testing Report of those vendors who have been recommended as technically compliant', ' The commercial offer should normally have a validity period of twelve months from the date of submission of the offer to ensure that the offer is still valid when the commercial bid is opened, commercial negotiations held and the order placed', ' A shorter validity period may be prescribed commensurate with the period of trial/testing', '\\n\\nDispensing with Trial Evaluation/Testing: For equipment available commercially off-the-shelf (COTS), which are upgrades of in-service items and have requisite IS/BIS or equivalent certification, the Service Headquarters may accept the equipment on the basis of self-certification by the vendor without going through the validation/testing process, provided it is confirmed by the QA Agency/AHSP or any other technical agency concerned', ' However, in such cases also TEC Report should be approved by the CFA', '\\n\\nProcedure to be Followed for Upgradation, Refurbishment, Re- Equipment, Modification, Technical Life Extension and Overhaul: For upgradation, refurbishment, etc', ', as mentioned in paragraph 4', '18', '2 (b) above, the vendors should be short-listed with the prior approval of the CFA and with the concurrence of integrated finance and the short listed vendors may be provided an opportunity to survey the weapon platform/systems, etc', ', which is to undergo upgradation/refurbishment/re- equipment/ modification/Technical Life Extension/Overhaul prior to issue of the RFP', ' In case the upgrade, refurbishment, etc', ' is to be done in India,\\n\\n\\nthe vendors should certify the capability and confirm the adequacy of the facility to the satisfaction of the Service Headquarters', ' If required, a Detailed Project Report (DPR) may be got prepared by the Service Headquarters after obtaining the AON but before issuing the RFP with a view to defining the scope and other technical details of the upgrade/OH programme', '\\n\\nSpecial provisions to be made in the RFP: The RFP for upgradation, refurbishment, etc', ' should invite technical and commercial offers separately and may also have a provision for pre-bid conference prior to submission of the offers so that the technical and other issues could be clarified to vendors', ' The RFP should ask the vendors to specify the location of the plant/factory where upgradation, refurbishment, etc', ' will be undertaken and whether the vendor owns the facility', ' If the facility is not owned by the vendor, a certificate of agreement between the OEM and the plant owner would be required to be submitted by the vendors along with their offer', ' There should be a provision in the RFP that one lead equipment (where there are more than one number) will be tested by the vendor along with the representatives of the Service Headquarters (either in India or abroad) before the balance equipments are taken up for upgradation, refurbishment, etc', ' In case of a single weapon platform, there should be a provision for concurrent testing along with the upgradation, refurbishment, etc', '\\n\\nApproval of the Final TEC Report and Opening of Commercial Offer: The TEC Report should be approved by the CFA and the commercial offer of the vendors who have been recommended as technically compliant should be opened only thereafter', ' This would be applicable in respect of cases covered by paragraph 4', '19', '2 (b)', '\\n\\nValidity of the Offer: The commercial offer should have a validity of up to eighteen months from the date of submission of the offer, depending on the period required for completing the technical evaluation, so as to ensure that the offer remains valid till the time the order is placed/contract signed', '\\n\\nAssessment of the Vendor’s Facility: If required and considered necessary, a composite delegation of representatives of the User Department, CFA and integrated finance may be deputed to visit the plant/factory of the vendor finally recommended by the CNC to assess the capability/capacity of the selected vendors to carry out upgradation, refurbishment, etc', ' before commercial negotiations are finalized and approved by the CFA', '\\n\\n\\nInstruction to Bidders\\n\\n\\tInstruction to Bidders: Subject to other specific provisions in this Manual, the broad instructions for the prospective bidders are as follows:\\n\\nEligibility: A firm registered with any Procurement/Registering Authority for the manufacture/supply of the tendered goods/services would be eligible to bid', ' An unregistered firm may get itself assessed for capacity/competency to manufacture/supply the tendered goods/services to become eligible to participate in tendering', '\\n\\nClarification regarding contents of the Bidding Documents: A prospective bidder who requires clarification regarding the contents of the bidding documents shall notify the purchaser in writing and the purchaser will respond in writing to the clarifications sought not later than fourteen days prior to the date of opening of the tenders', ' Copies of the query and clarification by the purchaser shall be sent to all prospective bidders who have received the bidding documents', '\\n\\nQuotations to be submitted under original memos: Bids should be forwarded by vendors under their original memo /letter pad, inter alia, furnishing the TIN No', ', VAT/ CST No', ', Bank Address with EFT account No', ' and the complete postal and e-mail address of the firm', '', '\\n\\nAmendment of Bidding Documents: At any time prior to the date of submission of bids the purchaser may, whether at his own initiative or in response to a clarification requested by a prospective bidder, may modify bid documents by amendments', ' The amendments shall be notified in writing to all prospective bidders', ' In order to afford prospective bidder a reasonable time to take the amendment into account in preparing their bids, the purchaser may, at his discretion, extend the deadline for submission of bids', '\\n\\nBid Validity: A bid shall remain valid for ninety days in case of single bid RFP and one hundred twenty days in case of two-bid system, unless otherwise specified, from the date of the opening of the tender', ' A bid valid for shorter period can be rejected by the purchaser, as being non- responsive', ' In exceptional circumstances the purchaser may request the consent of the bidder for an extension to the period of bid validity', ' Such requests shall be made in writing', ' The bid security provided shall also be suitably extended', ' A bidder accepting the request and granting extension shall not be permitted to modify his bid', '\\n\\nLate Bids: In the case of advertised tender enquiry or limited tender enquiry, late bids (i', 'e', ' bids received after the specified date and time for\\n\\n\\nreceipt of bids) should not be considered and returned unopened to the bidder', '\\n\\nModification and Withdrawal of Bids: A bidder may modify or withdraw his bid after submission provided that the written notice of modification or withdrawal is received by the purchaser prior to deadline prescribed for submission of bids', ' A withdrawal notice may be sent by fax but it should be followed by a signed confirmation copy to be sent by post and such signed confirmation should reach the purchaser not later than the deadline for submission of bids', ' No bid shall be modified after the deadline for submission of bids', ' No bid may be withdrawn in the interval between the deadline for submission of bids and expiration of the period of bid validity specified', ' Withdrawal of a bid during this period will result in Bidder’s forfeiture of bid security', '\\n\\nClarification regarding contents of the Bids: During evaluation and comparison of bids, the purchaser may, at its discretion, ask the bidder for clarification of his bid', ' The request for clarification shall be in writing and no change in prices or substance of the bid shall be sought, offered or permitted', ' No post bid clarification on the initiative of the bidder shall be entertained', '\\n\\nAgents of the supplier: One agent cannot represent two suppliers or quote on their behalf in a particular tender enquiry', ' Such quote should be rejected', '\\n\\nInstruction to the Purchase Officers\\n\\nInstruction to the Purchaser: Subject to other specific provisions of this Manual, the broad instructions for the purchase officers are as follows:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Purchaser shall evaluate the bids to determine whether they are complete; whether any computational errors have been made; whether required sureties have been furnished; whether essential documents such as the technical literature and Agency Agreement in the case of medical stores, etc', ', as specified in the RFP have been furnished; whether the bid documents have been properly signed; and, whether the bids are generally in order', '\\n\\nDiscrepancy in quoted price: If there is a discrepancy between unit price and the total price, the unit price shall prevail', ' If there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words shall prevail', ' If a supplier does not accept the correction of the errors, his bid should be rejected and the bid security may be forfeited', '\\n\\n\\nTrivial errors: Trivial errors such as omission to (i) enter the rates in words, (ii) initial any alteration in rates or (iii) sign both the tender and the schedules(s) may be corrected, initialed and dated both by the officers opening the tenders and signed and dated by subsequently by the tenderer', '\\n\\nResponsiveness of the bid: Prior to detailed evaluation, the purchaser should determine the substantial responsiveness of each bid to the bid documents', ' A substantially responsive bid is the one which conforms to all terms and conditions of the bid documents without material deviations', ' Deviations from or objections or reservations to critical provisions like Bid Security, Warranty & Guarantee, Applicable Law, Taxes and Duties and non-submission of documents such as valid Agency Agreement and technical literature in the case of medical stores should be deemed to be a material deviation', '\\n\\nEvaluation and comparison of substantially responsive bids: The evaluation and comparison of responsive bids shall be done on the prices of the goods offered inclusive of all levies & taxes, such as VAT, Excise Duty and other charges such as Packing & Forwarding, Freight and Insurance etc', ', as indicated in the price schedule of the Bid document but exclusive of Octroi/Entry Tax, which is to be paid extra as per actual, wherever applicable', '\\n\\nAward Criteria: The purchaser will award contract to the successful bidder whose bid has been determined to be substantially responsive and has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid, provided further that the bidder is found to be technically, commercially and financially acceptable and whose goods have been type-approved/validated by the purchaser', ' The purchaser reserves the right to counter offer price(s) against price(s) quoted by any bidder', '\\n\\nWaiver of QRs/parameters: There should be no waiver of parameters after the issue of RFP as this may result in denial of opportunity to firms which could have met the revised essential parameters, had this been reflected in the RFP ab initio', ' This is particularly relevant in single vendor/resultant single vendor cases where waiver of essential parameters after issue of RFP and receipt of tenders would be prejudicial to the interest of other firms which might have submitted their bids as per the revised parameters but could not because of the essential parameters mentioned in the RFP', '\\n\\nPre-bid conference: To obviate the possibility of the RFP fetching no response, resulting in a single vendor situation or resulting in generation of limited competition, technical specifications should be firmed up in a pre- bid conference in two-bid tender, particularly where the goods/services to\\n\\n\\nbe procured are not available commercially off-the-shelf or are of complex and highly technical nature', ' No fresh commercial bids should be invited after opening of technical bids', '\\n\\n\\n*******\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nAPPROVAL PROCESS AND CONCLUSION OF CONTRACT\\n\\nProcurement of Goods and Services\\n\\nProcurement of Goods: The need for procurement of goods may arise in the following circumstances:\\n\\nto make up the deficiency of stores, which are authorized as per scales laid down in various Government letters, revealed as a result of provisioning reviews;\\nto build up authorized stocks; or\\non account of non-scaled and not-in-vocabulary (NIV) items, which may include any kind of equipment, spares and other medical/ miscellaneous stores', '\\n\\nProcurement of Services: The need for procurement of services may arise for any of the following reasons:\\n\\nmaintenance of any equipment/asset already held on charge;\\nperformance of any task being performed in-house but considered appropriate for outsourcing;\\nneed for engaging consultants;\\nany new function which can be performed economically by an outside agency', '\\n\\nProcessing of Procurement Proposals\\n\\nProcessing of Proposals for CFA’s Approval: All procurement proposals should be initiated in the form of a statement of case (SOC), which should clearly bring out all aspects of the proposal, including the justification/reason for procurement, quantity, cost, likely sources of supply, mode of tendering, etc', ' The format of SoC given in Appendix ‘B’ may be used for this purpose, with suitable changes as required', ' It needs to be kept in view that expeditious processing of the proposal depends on the comprehensibility and quality of the SoC', ' Draft NIT/RFP should also be submitted along with the SOC for approval of the CFA in consultation with integrated finance, where required as per the delegation of financial powers', '\\n\\nCosting of Procurement Proposals: It is important that the procurement proposal is costed with due attention and care', ' The basis of costing must be placed on record', ' The level of approval by the CFA would depend on the entire cost of a proposal, inclusive of all taxes, levies and other charges', ' The procedure for costing is given in Chapter 13 of this Manual', '\\n\\n\\n\\nProcessing of Proposals after CFA’s Approval: After CFA’s approval, the procuring agency is required to go through the tendering action approval as per the provisions of Chapter 4 of this Manual and obtain CFA’s approval for the proposed procurement in consultation with integrated finance, where required as per the delegation of financial powers', '\\n\\nProcessing of Proposals Subject to Availability of Funds: A procurement proposal should normally be processed only if it figures in the Annual Procurement Plan (wherever such Plans are being prepared, irrespective of the nomenclature of the Plan) and subject to availability of funds', ' Availability of funds should be determined only after accounting for cash outgo during the relevant financial year on account of committed liabilities', '\\n\\nProcessing of Proposals Without Linking Them With Availability of Funds: Subject to the general rule that purchase proposals should be processed with due regard to availability of funds, a procurement proposal may be processed without linking it with actual availability of funds, if it is certified by the budget holder that there is reasonable certainty of funds becoming available by the time the proposal reaches the final stage of contracting/placing of supply order', ' In such cases, however, availability of funds would be determined after taking into account cash outgo on account of the committed liabilities', '\\n\\nPrior Concurrence of Integrated Finance: Competent Financial Authority’s approval is subject to prior concurrence of integrated finance, if required as per the delegation of financial powers', '\\n\\nEx-post Facto Financial Concurrence: There is no provision under the delegated financial powers to obtain ex-post facto concurrence of integrated finance', ' Such cases where prior concurrence is not obtained, though required as per the delegation of financial powers, would be treated as cases of breach of rules and regulations and referred to the next higher CFA for regularization', ' Such regularization will be subject to concurrence of IFA to the next higher CFA', '\\n\\nEx-post Facto Approval of the CFA: Where a proposal is approved, with or without the concurrence of integrated finance, by an authority not competent to sanction that proposal as per the delegation of financial powers, ex-post facto sanction may be accorded by the appropriate CFA with or without the concurrence of the IFA, as the case may be, as per delegation of financial powers', '\\n\\n\\nDisagreement with the IFA: In case of disagreement with the IFA, the CFA can overrule the IFA under intimation to the next higher CFA as well as the IFA giving reasons for overruling the financial advice', ' In such cases, it would be open to the IFA to take up the matter with the higher IFA and CFA or drop it', '\\n\\nAcceptance of Necessity\\n\\nAcceptance of Necessity in Respect of Scaled Items: Acceptance of Necessity in case of scaled items would actually only entail vetting of quantities, assessment of physical requirement of various resources with respect to targets fixed and budget availability', '\\n\\nAcceptance of Necessity In Respect of Scaled Items Whose Inventory is Computerized: In case of scaled items where inventories are maintained through automated systems and IFAs have been provided terminal on the same, IFA will vet the quantity on the automated systems based on data available on such automated systems, which would be deemed to be financial concurrence for acceptance of necessity also', '\\n\\nAcceptance of Necessity in Respect of Non-Scaled and NIV Items: Acceptance of necessity in respect of non-scaled and NIV items would depend entirely on the justification provided for their procurement', ' It must be ensured that procurement of such items does not introduce a new practice and does not have the effect of changing the existing scales or policy', '\\n\\nAcceptance of Necessity in Respect of Items Included in Procurement Plans: Some of the Services HQrs/Command HQrs and other establishments prepare annual procurement plans for revenue procurement', ' Where such a plan, irrespective of its nomenclature, is being prepared with the concurrence of Integrated Finance, necessity would be deemed to have been accepted in respect of each item included in the plan', ' No separate AON would be necessary in such cases', ' However, the AON would be for the item and not the quantities required', ' In such cases, however, Integrated Finance should be consulted for vetting of quantity, mode of tendering, identification of vendors in case of LTE/STE/PAC and vetting of draft RFP, where financial powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance', '\\n\\nProvided that if in any such case Integrated Finance wishes to make any observation regarding necessity, it may be done with the specific approval of the IFA concerned', ' Further processing of the proposal would, however, not be deferred pending resolution of the issue raised by Integrated Finance, unless the procuring agency considers it desirable to resolve the issue before proceeding further', ' Where it is decided not to defer further processing of the proposal, the observations made by Integrated Finance\\n\\n\\nwould be brought to the notice of the CFA while seeking approval for the proposal', '\\n\\nProvided further that AON of the CFA would need to be taken in consultation with the IFA, where financial powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance, before the proposal is processed any further in case of non-scaled items which do not also figure in any approved procurement plan', '\\n\\nQuantity Vetting\\n\\nQuantity Vetting in Respect of Scaled Items: Care should be taken to avoid purchasing quantities in excess of requirement to avoid inventory carrying costs', ' The IFA is supposed to vet the quantity indented/ projected for procurement of scaled items so as to ensure timely provisioning', ' In order to ensure that there is no infructuous provisioning, the IFA must have access to all inputs required to assess the basis of the projection of indented quantity', ' The calculation sheet showing the authorized scales, dues-in, dues-out, reserves, etc', ' must be made available to the IFA', ' In case an IT based management system is operational in the department, the IFA is to undertake such vetting of quantity on the system itself\\n\\nQuantity Vetting in Respect of Non-scaled and NIV Items: While no fixed guidelines can be laid down for vetting of quantities of non-scaled and NIV items, it has to be ensured that purchase proposals of such items are based on the bare minimum inescapable requirement with due regard to economy of scales', ' Where financial powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance, IFA should vet the quantity of such items if the procurement is proposed to be made under the delegated financial powers exercisable with the concurrence of integrated finance', ' If requirement of such items is found to be arising repeatedly, central procurement agencies should be intimated about the requirement', '\\n\\nSeeking Approval of the CFA\\n\\nCombining Various Stages of Processing: It is not necessary that a proposal should be processed sequentially for AON, Quantity Vetting, financial concurrence, etc', ' A proposal, when initiated, should be complete in all respects so that all the aspects relating to AON, quantity vetting, costing, vetting of NIT/RFP, etc', ', could be examined simultaneously by the IFA, where required as per the delegation of financial powers', '\\n\\nCFA’s Sanction: A sanction is a written authority from the CFA authorizing the expenditure', ' A sanction invariably indicates the reference to the authority under which expenditure is being sanctioned, the financial implication, the item for which the expenditure is approved and the budget code head', ' Whenever the final expenditure exceeds the sanctioned\\n\\n\\namount, revised financial sanction of the CFA, in whose delegated powers the total expenditure would fall, is required to be obtained', ' The format for Sanction letter is given in Appendix K', '\\n\\nTransparency, Competition, Fairness and Elimination of Arbitrariness in the Procurement Process:\\n\\nNeed for Ensuring Propriety of Procurement Process: All government purchases should be made in a transparent, competitive and fair manner, to secure best value for money', ' This will also enable the prospective bidders to formulate and send their competitive bids with confidence', ' Some of the measures for ensuring the above are as follows:\\n\\nthe text of the bidding document should be self-contained and comprehensive without any ambiguities', ' All essential information, which a bidder needs for sending responsive bid, should be clearly spelt out in the bidding document in simple language', ' The bidding document should contain, inter alia:\\n\\nthe criteria for eligibility and qualifications to be met by the bidders such as minimum level of experience, past performance, technical capability, manufacturing facilities and financial position etc', ';\\n\\neligibility criteria for goods, indicating any legal restrictions or conditions about the origin of goods etc which may be required to be met by the successful bidder;\\n\\nthe procedure as well as date, time and place for sending the bids;\\n\\ndate, time and place of opening of the bid;\\n\\nterms of delivery;\\n\\nspecial terms affecting performance, if any', '\\n\\nSuitable provision should be kept in the bidding document to enable a bidder to question the bidding conditions, bidding process and/ or rejection of its bid', '\\n\\nSuitable provision for settlement of disputes, if any, emanating from the resultant contract, should be kept in the bidding document', '\\n\\nThe bidding document should indicate clearly that the resultant contract will be interpreted under Indian Laws', '\\n\\n\\nThe bidders should be given reasonable time to send their bids', '\\n\\nThe bids should be opened in public and authorized representatives of the bidders should be permitted to attend the bid opening', '\\n\\nThe specifications of the required goods should be clearly stated without any ambiguity so that the prospective bidders can send meaningful bids', ' In order to attract sufficient number of bidders, the specification should be broad based to the extent feasible', ' Efforts should also be made to use standard specifications which are widely known to the industry', '\\n\\nResponsibility of the CFA\\n\\nResponsibility of CFA in Purchase Decision: The CFA must consider all aspects of the case, including the quoted terms and conditions of the contract, delivery period, taxes and duties applicable, freight, insurance and other charges and the compliance to the specification before a purchase decision is taken', ' One of the important responsibilities of the CFA to ensure proper ranking of all offers so that the decision making process is totally transparent', ' The financial implication should be considered as the all-inclusive cost to the User on delivery to the designated consignee(s)', ' Conditional offers and those with specifications not in conformity with the tendered specifications (Essential QRs) should not be considered', ' Before according sanction, concurrence of integrated finance should be taken wherever the powers are exercisable subject to such concurrence', '\\n\\nCompliance with Procedures: While taking the purchase decision, the CFA needs to satisfy himself that proper procedures have been followed at various stages of procurement, purchase policies of the Government have been complied with and capacity and financial status of the firm have been checked', ' Purchase decisions should be taken through a formal order in a written form', '\\n\\nAccountability: The decentralization of decision making mechanism and delegation of financial powers are aimed at facilitating faster decision making and obtaining best value for money', ' However, the delegation of powers also implies ‘authority with accountability’', ' The CFA approving the expenditure must ensure financial propriety and probity, transparency and fair play as well as optimum utilization of resources', ' The designated CFA and all members of committee CFA are accountable for all decisions taken by them while approving any measure involving Government funds', ' This accountability is unconditional and absolute', '\\n\\n\\n\\nTime frame\\n\\nNeed for Expeditious Processing: It is imperative that the procurement process is fully responsive to the need of the Defence Services and other departments and facilitates expeditious procurement so that requirements are met on time', ' It is, therefore, essential that all prescribed activities are undertaken expeditiously and advice rendered within a specified time frame', '\\n\\n\\tTime Frame: The time frame as given in Appendix ‘A’ is suggested for all activities in the procurement process to ensure that the bids are finalized within validity period', ' In case the prescribed time frame cannot be adhered to in any specific case, suitable extension of validity of the bids should invariably be asked for well in time', '\\n\\n*******\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6 CONTRACT\\nLaw\\n\\nElementary Law: The elements and principles of contract law and the meaning and import of various legal terms used in connection with the contracts are contained in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 read with the Sale of Goods Act, 1930', ' The law relating to redressal of disputes is laid down in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996', ' Some of the salient principles relating to contracts are set out briefly in this chapter', '\\n\\nApplicability to Defence Procurement: Government contracts, including those for defence procurement, are governed by the same laws which are applicable to contracts between private parties', '\\n\\nElementary Legal Practices\\n\\nWhat is a Contract?: The proposal or offer when accepted is a promise, a promise and every set of promises forming the consideration for each other is an agreement, and an agreement if made with free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object is a contract', '\\n\\nProposal or Offer: When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of the other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal or offer', ' In a sale or purchase by tender, the tender signed by the tenderer is the proposal', ' The invitation to tender and instructions to tenderers do not constitute a proposal', '\\n\\nAcceptance of the Proposal: When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted', ' A proposal when accepted becomes a promise', '\\n\\nWhich agreements are Contracts?: An agreement is a contract enforceable by law when the following are satisfied', ' A defect affecting any of these renders a contract un-enforceable', '\\n\\nCompetency of the parties\\nFreedom of consent of both parties\\nLawfulness of consideration\\nLawfulness of object\\n\\n\\n\\nCompetency of Parties\\n\\nWho Can Enter Into Contract?: Under law any person who has attained majority and is of sound mind or not debarred by law to which he is subject, may enter into contracts', ' It, therefore, follows that minors and persons of unsound mind cannot enter into contracts nor can insolvent person do so', '\\n\\nCategories of Parties to the Contract: Categories of persons and bodies who are parties to the contract may be broadly sub-divided under the following heads: -\\n\\nIndividuals\\nPartnerships\\nLimited Companies\\nCorporations other than limited companies\\n\\nContracts with Individuals: Individuals tender either in their own name or in the name and style of their business', ' If the tender is signed by any person other than the concerned individual, the authority of the person signing the tender on behalf of another must be verified and a proper power of attorney authorizing such person should be insisted on', ' In case, a tender is submitted in a business name and if it is a concern of an individual, the constitution of the business and the capacity of the individual must appear on the face of the contract and the tender signed by the individual himself as proprietor or by his duly authorized attorney', '\\n\\nContracts with Partnerships: A partnership is an association of two or more individuals formed for the purpose of doing business jointly under a business name', ' It is also called a firm', ' It should be noted that a partnership is not a legal entity by itself, apart from the individuals constituting it', ' A partner is the implied authority to bind the firm in a contract coming in the purview of the usual business of the firm', ' The implied authority of a partner, however, does not extend to enter into arbitration agreement on behalf of the firm', ' While entering into a contract with partnership firm care should be taken to verify the existence of consent of all the partners to the arbitration agreement', '\\n\\nContracts with Limited Companies: Companies are associations of individuals registered under Companies Act in which the liability of the members comprising the association is limited to the extent of the shares held by them in such companies', ' The company, after its incorporation or registration, is an artificial legal person, which has an existence quite distinct and separate from the members of shareholders comprising the same', ' A company is not empowered to enter into a contract for purposes not covered by its memorandum of association; any such agreement in\\n\\n\\nexcess of power entered into the company is void and cannot be enforced', ' Therefore, in cases of doubt, the company must be asked to produce its memorandum for verification or the position may be verified by an inspection of the memorandum from the office of the Registrar of Companies before entering into a contract', ' Normally, any one of the Directors of the company is empowered to present the company', ' Where tenders are signed by persons other than Directors or authorized Managing Agents, it may be necessary to examine if the person signing the tender is authorized by the company to enter into contracts on its behalf', '\\n\\nCorporation other than Limited Companies: Associations of individuals incorporated under statutes such as Trade Union Act, Cooperative Societies Act and Societies Registration Act are also artificial persons in the eye of law and are entitled to enter into such contracts as are authorized by their memorandum of association', ' If any contract has to be entered into with any one of such corporations or associations, the capacity of such associations to enter into contract should be verified and also the authority of the person coming forward to represent the said associations', '\\n\\nParties to Defence Contracts: The parties to the defence contracts are the President of India as the purchaser acting through the authority signing the Contract/Agreement/Purchase Order etc', ', and the supplier named in the contract', '\\n\\nConsent of both the Parties\\n\\nConsent of Both Parties: Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense', ' When two persons dealing with each other have their minds directed to different objects or attach different meanings to the language which they use, there is no agreement', ' The misunderstanding which is incompatible with agreement may occur in the following cases: -\\n\\nWhen the misunderstanding relates to the identity of the other party to the agreement;\\nWhen it relates to the nature or terms of the transactions;\\nWhen it related to the subject matter of the agreement', '\\n\\nFree Consent of the Parties: The consent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake', ' Consent is said to be so caused when it would not have been given but for the existence of coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake', ' When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was caused', ' A party to a\\n\\n\\ncontract, whose consent was caused by fraud or misrepresentation may, if he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the representations made had been true', '\\n\\nConsent Given Under Mistake:   In case consent to an agreement has been given under a mistake, the position is slightly different', ' When both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter essential to the agreement, the agreement is not voidable but void', ' When the mistake is unilateral on the part of one party only, the agreement is not void', '\\n\\nMistake of Fact and Law: Distinction has also to be drawn between a mistake of fact and a mistake of law', ' A contract is not void because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in India but a mistake as to law not in force in India has the same effect as a mistake of fact', '\\n\\nConsideration\\n\\nWhat is Consideration? Consideration is something which is advantageous to the promisor or which is onerous or disadvantageous to the promisee', ' Inadequacy of consideration is, however, not a ground avoiding the contract', ' But an act, forbearance or promise, which in contemplation of law has no value, is no consideration and likewise an act or a promise, which is illegal or impossible, has no value', '\\n\\nLawfulness of Object\\n\\nLawfulness of Object: The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless it is forbidden by law or is of such a nature that if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent or involves or implies injury to the fraudulent property of another or the court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy', ' In each of these cases the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful', '\\n\\nCommunication of an Offer/Proposal and Acceptance\\n\\nCommunication of an Offer or Proposal: The communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made', ' A time is generally provided in the tender forms for submission of the tender', ' Purchaser is not bound to consider a tender, which is received beyond that time', '\\n\\nCommunication of Acceptance: A date is invariably fixed in tender forms upto which tenders are open for acceptance', ' A proposal or offer stands revoked by the lapse of time prescribed in such offer for its acceptance', ' If, therefore, in case it is not possible to decide a tender within the period of\\n\\n\\nvalidity of the offer as originally made, the consent of the tenderer firm should be obtained to keep the offer open for further period or periods', '\\n\\nWhen is communication of Acceptance Complete? The communication of an acceptance is complete as against the proposer or offerer, where it is put in the course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of the acceptor, and it is complete as against the acceptor when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer or offerer', ' The medium of communication in government contracts is generally by post and the acceptance is, therefore, complete as soon as it is posted', ' So that there might be no possibility of a dispute regarding the date of communication of acceptance, it should be sent to the correct address by some authentic foolproof mode like registered post acknowledgement due, etc', '\\n\\nAcceptance to be Identical with Proposal: If the terms of the tender or the tender, as revised, and modified, are not accepted or if the terms of the offer and the acceptance are not the same, the acceptance remains a mere counter offer and there is no concluded contract', ' It should, therefore, be ensured that the terms incorporated in the acceptance are not at variance with the offer or the tender and that none of the terms of the tender are left out', ' In case, uncertain terms are used by the tenderers, clarifications should be obtained before such tenders are considered for acceptance', ' If it is considered that a counter offer should be made, such counter offer should be carefully drafted, as a contract is to take effect on acceptance thereof', ' If the subject matter of the contract is impossible of fulfillment or is in itself in violation of law such contract is void', '\\n\\nWithdrawal of an Offer/Proposal and Acceptance\\n\\nWithdrawal of an Offer or Proposal: A tenderer firm, which is the proposer, may withdraw its offer at any time before its acceptance, even though the firm might have offered to keep the offer open for a specified period', ' It is equally open to the tenderer to revise or modify his offer', ' Such withdrawal, revision or modification must reach the accepting authority before the date and time of opening of tender', ' No legal obligations arise out of such withdrawal or revision or modification of the offer as a simple offer is without a consideration', ' Where, however, a tenderer agrees to keep his offer open for a specified period for a consideration, such offers cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the specified date', ' This would be so where earnest money is deposited by the tenderer in consideration of his being supplied the subsidiary contract and withdrawal of offer by the tenderer before the specified period would entitle the purchaser to forfeit the earnest money', '\\n\\n\\nWithdrawal of Acceptance: An acceptance can be withdrawn before such acceptance comes to the knowledge of the tenderer', ' A telegraphic revocation of acceptance, which reaches the tenderer before the letter of acceptance, will be a valid revocation', '\\n\\nSigning, Acceptance and Stamping of the Defence Contracts\\n\\nWho can Sign the Defence Contracts?

into force with the acceptance of the tender as per mutually agreed terms and conditions contained in the RFP and the firm’s offer', ' However, in the case of supply orders, the firm should check the supply order and convey acceptance of the same within seven days of receipt of the supply order', ' If such an acceptance or communication conveying their objection to certain parts of the contract is

provides for price variation clauses or the change is due to variation in Excise/Custom Duties/other Government taxes & levies and the contract provides for payment of these duties on the basis of actual rates, provided the supplies are made during the original delivery period', ' Consultation with Integrated Finance in such cases would be required if the original contract was concluded with the concurrence of Integrated Finance or, after increase in value, the contract falls within the delegated powers of the CFA, exercisable with the concurrence of Integrated Finance', '\\n\\nVetting of Price Variation Clause: Financial Advisor should be consulted for vetting of price variation clauses/exchange rate variation clauses', '\\n\\nImposition of LD While Granting Extensions: While granting

undertaken, documents may be selected from the list given above and specified in the RFP and supply order/contract', ']\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\nDelivery: Timely delivery as per the delivery period (DP) stipulation in the Contract/Purchase Order is one of the most important procurement objectives as timely availability of items is vital, particularly for the department of defence', ' The stores are considered to have been delivered only when these are handed over to the consignee after due inspection by the designated inspecting agency', ' Most contracts stipulate door delivery at the consignee’s end by road', ' In some cases, the stores are also despatched by rail, in which case the delivery is deemed to have been\\n\\n\\nmade on receipt of RR and inspection note', ' In certain cases where the contractor offers stores for inspection during the last few days of contract DP or on the last day of the contract DP, the inspector can inspect the store and sentence it as per standard franking clause', '\\n\\n[As per the standard franking clause, the fact that the stores have been inspected after the delivery period and accepted by the inspectorate does not bind the purchaser, unless at his discretion he agrees, to accept delivery thereof', ' The stores are accepted without prejudice to the right of the Purchaser', ']\\n\\nCorrectness of the Quality and Quantity: On receipt at the consignee’s premises, the stores are checked for ascertaining the correctness of quantity, quality and documents', ' In case the stores are found deficient in any way, the consignee has the right to reject the stores even if these were inspected and cleared by the inspector', '\\n\\nFailure to deliver within the DP: When the supplies do not materialize by the stipulated contract delivery date, the purchaser has the option of:\\n\\nExtending the delivery date with imposition of LD and denial clause, which implies denial of increase in price, taxes, duties, etc', ' taking place during the extended period', '\\n\\nRe-fixing the delivery date', '\\n\\nCanceling the contract and repurchasing the non-supplied quantity', '\\n\\nDeciding the Course of Action in the Event of Failure of Supply: For deciding on these options the Procuring Authority has to balance the time factor required for making repurchase and whether the supply can be arranged earlier than the period of extension sought for at cheaper rates from alternative sources and in the latter case whether the indentor can reasonably wait to take advantage of lower trend in prices', ' Extension shall be granted only where the CFA is convinced that supplier would come forward during extended DP', ' Detailed instructions are contained in chapter 12 of DGS &D Manual 1999', ' Suggested format for correspondence/amendment on this issue has been given in Forms DPM- 26, DPM-27, DPM-28 and DPM-29 for guidance', '\\n\\n\\tMaximum Period of Extension: The maximum period of extension of delivery that can be granted by the CFA under delegated powers should be such that the total period - the original delivery period plus the extension – does not exceed twice the original delivery period', ' Extensions beyond this period would require sanction of the Ministry of Defence', '\\n\\n\\n\\nLiquidated Damages (LD)\\n\\n\\tLiquidated damages: Compensation of loss on account of late delivery where loss is pre-estimated and mutually agreed to is termed as the Liquidated Damage (LD)', ' Law allows recovery of pre-estimated loss, provided such a term is included in the contract', ' For imposition of LD, there is no need to establish actual loss due to late supply', ' The legal position with regard to claim for liquidated damages is as follows:\\n\\nWhatever the quantum of the loss sustained, the claim cannot exceed the sum stipulated in the contract', '\\n\\nOnly reasonable sum can be calculated as damages, which in given situation may be less than the sum stipulated', '\\n\\nWhat is a reasonable sum would depend on facts', '\\n\\nCourt may proceed on the assumption that the sum stipulated reflects the genuine pre-estimates of the parties as to the probable loss and such clause is intended to dispense with proof thereof', '\\n\\nThe distinction between penalty and LD has been abolished by the Indian Contract Act and in every case, the Court is not bound to award more than ‘reasonable compensation’ not exceeding the amount so named', '\\n\\n\\tQuantum of LD: As a general rule, if the contractor fails to deliver the stores/service or any installment thereof within the DP or at any time repudiates the contract before expiry of such period, the CFA, without prejudice to the right of the purchaser to any other remedy for breach of contract, may recover from the contractor a sum equivalent to 0', '5% of the prices of any stores which the contractor has failed to deliver within the period agreed for delivery in the contract, for each week or part thereof during which the delivery of such stores may be in arrears, where delivery thereof is accepted after expiry of the aforesaid period', ' The total damages shall not exceed value of 10% of undelivered goods', ' The LD cannot exceed the amount stipulated in the contract', '\\n\\nGuidelines for levying of LD: The following guidelines would be followed while taking decision for imposition of LD:\\n\\n\\n\\nSr No Circumstances Quantum of LD  1 Delay in supplies resulted in actual/ demonstrable monetary loss and the Supplier was responsible for the delay Full LD as per the provisions of paragraph 7', '8', '2, subject to the LD not exceeding 10% of the value of the contract  2 Delay in supplies resulted in actual/ demonstrable monetary loss but the Supplier was responsible only for a part of the delay and the remaining part was beyond Supplier’s control Full LD for the period for which the Supplier was responsible for the delay, subject to the LD not exceeding 10% of the value of the contract  3 Delay in supplies resulted in actual/ demonstrable monetary loss but the entire delay was due to circumstances beyond the control of the Supplier LD may be waived in full  4 Actual/demonstrable monetary loss cannot be certified and no\\ninconvenience has been caused LD may be waived in full  \\n\\tWaiver of LD: Liquidated damages may be waived in full or part, as per the guidelines contained in the preceding paragraph, with the approval of the CFA and the concurrence of the IFA, wherever such concurrence is mandated as per delegation of financial powers', ' In all such cases, adequate reasons should invariably be recorded for waiving the Liquidated Damages', '\\n\\n\\tConsequential Damages: Consequential damage is imposed over and above LD in case of time critical Turn-key Projects', ' Where considered necessary, it should be included in the RFP and the contract', '\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\n\\tArbitration: If a dispute arises between the Purchaser and the Supplier and it does not get resolved through mutual discussions, the parties may agree for arbitration', ' MOD/CFAs should prepare a panel of arbitrators for selection by the Defence Secretary /CFA’s who appoint an arbitrator, whose decisions taken after due consideration of factors brought out by both parties are considered final', ' The option of approaching Ministry of Law for appointment of

Purchase officers must consult the Legal Advisor (Defence) and Government counsel in all cases of arbitration', '\\n\\nForce Majeure\\n\\n\\tForce Majeure: Wherever considered necessary, this clause may be included in the RFP and in the Contract', ' In this context provisions of paragraph 10', '9 of this Manual will apply, mutatis mutandis, to procurement from indigenous sources also, though this clause should be included in such contracts only if absolutely necessary', ' The standard format of the clause is given in Part-IV of Appendix C', '\\n\\nOption Clause and Repeat Order Clause\\n\\nRepeat Order and Option Clauses: Provision for repeat order and option clause should not be made as a matter of course in the RFPs as these clauses have an impact on price', ' Either or both these clauses may be provided in the RFP only in exceptional circumstances, where the consumption pattern is not predictable, with the stipulation that while exercising one or both these clauses the overall ceiling of fifty percent of the originally contracted quantity will not be exceeded', ' Repeat Order and/or Option Clause may be exercised more than once, provided altogether these orders do not exceed 50% of the original order quantity', '\\n\\nOption Clause: Under this clause, the Purchaser retains the right to place orders for additional quantity up to a maximum of 50% of the originally contracted quantity at the same rate and terms of the contract', ' Such an option is available during the original period of contract provided this clause had been incorporated in the original contract with the supplier', ' Option quantity during extended DP is to be limited to 50% of balance quantity after original Delivery Period', ' This clause may be exercised in case of procurement from single vendor/OEM also subject to there being no downward trend in prices', ' However, in multi vendor contracts, great care should be exercised before operating the option clause', '\\n\\nConditions governing Option Clause: Against an outstanding indent for which acceptance of necessity has been approved by CFA, it may be advantageous to the Purchaser to exercise the option clause in accordance with the terms and conditions of contract', ' The option clause may be exercised on approval of the CFA, within whose powers total value of original supplies plus value of the option clause falls, in consultation with IFA, where applicable as per the delegation of financial\\n\\n\\npowers, during currency of the contract', ' It should be ensured that there is no downward trend in the market prices', ' No fruitful result will accrue by floating fresh RFP when items are urgently required', ' If the contract also contains the repeat order clause, it may be kept in mind while placing order under the option clause that the total quantity under the option clause and the repeat order cannot exceed fifty percent of the originally ordered quantity', '\\n\\n\\tRepeat Order: Wherever considered necessary, provision may be made in the RFP and the contract for Repeat Order', ' A Repeat order against a previous order may be placed at the same cost and terms and conditions as per the original order/contract with the approval by the CFA and concurrence of integrated finance, wherever required as per the delegation of financial powers', '\\n\\n\\tConditions Governing Repeat Order: A Repeat Order may be placed subject to the following:\\n\\nItems ordered against the previous order had been delivered successfully', '\\n\\nOriginal order should not have been placed to cover urgent/emergent demand', '\\n\\nRepeat Order is not placed to split the requirement to avoid obtaining the sanction of the next higher CFA', '\\n\\nThe original order should have been placed on the basis of lowest price negotiated and accepted by CNC, and not on the basis of delivery or any other preference', '\\n\\nThere is no downward trend in the price of the item', ' (A clear certificate should be recorded to that effect', ')\\n\\nThe requirement is for stores of identical nature/ specifications, nomenclature etc', ' Minor improvements in spec(s) or phasing out of products due to obsolescence should not be precluded from the purview of repeat order but this aspect should be very carefully examined from the point of view of interchangeability of the product offered as an improved substitute', '\\n\\nThe repeat order is to be placed within six months from the date of completion of the supply against the previous order and it should be placed only once', '\\n\\nThe repeat order quantity is to be restricted to a maximum of 50% of last order quantity in case of indigenous and foreign procurement,\\n\\n\\nwhere the contract does not also include the option clause', ' In case of orders for small quantities (1 to 7), the Repeat Order quantity may be rounded off to the next whole number', '\\n\\nThis provision may be exercised in case of PAC/Single vendor OEM also', ' However, care should be taken before exercising this provision in multi-vendor situation', '\\n\\nWhere the contract also includes an Option clause, Repeat Order may be placed only for such quantity, which, along with the quantity for which Option clause may have already been exercised, does not result in the total quantity under the Option clause and the Repeat Order exceeding 50% of the originally ordered quantity', '\\n\\nThe CFA will be decided taking into consideration the value of the originally ordered quantity and the Option clause/Repeat Order quantity', '\\n\\nRisk and Expense Purchase\\n\\nRisk & Expense Purchase: Risk and expense purchase clause may be included in the RFP and the contract, if considered necessary', ' Risk and Expense purchase is undertaken by the purchaser in the event of the supplier failing to honour the contracted obligations within the stipulated period and where extension of delivery period is not approved', ' While initiating risk purchase at the cost and expense of the supplier, the purchaser must satisfy himself that the supplier has failed to deliver and has been given adequate and proper notice to discharge his obligations', ' Whenever risk purchase is resorted to, the supplier is liable to pay the additional amount spent by the Government, if any, in procuring the said contracted goods/ services through a fresh contract, i', 'e', ' the defaulting supplier has to bear the excess cost incurred as compared with the amount contracted with him', ' Factors like method of recovering such amount should also be considered while taking a decision to invoke the provision for risk purchase', ' A Standard Risk & Expense Purchase clause is given in Part-IV of Appendix C', '\\n\\n7', '14', '2', ' Risk and Expense purchase clause not mandatory: Risk purchase at the cost and expense of the supplier may not always be a practical proposition as it may not be feasible to enforce recovery without legal action', ' This clause is rarely invoked in case of import contracts for this reason', ' In such cases where the item is of proprietary nature or there is only one qualified firm to supply the items and there is a remote possibility of procuring the same item from an alternative source, it will be essential that instead of having risk and cost clause in the contract, the contract should have performance guarantee clause to cover any such default', '\\n\\n\\nAlternative remedies to Risk & Expense Purchase Clause: In case of foreign contracts, risk and expense clause is generally not applicable', ' The other remedies available to the purchaser in the absence of the Risk and Expense Clause are as follows:\\n\\nDeduct the quantitative cost of discrepancy from any of the outstanding payments of the supplier', '\\n\\nAvoid issue of further RFP’s to the firm till resolution of the discrepancy', '\\nBring up the issue of discrepancy in all meetings with the representative of supplier', '\\n\\nProvide for adequate Bank Guarantee to cover such risks', '\\n\\n(e]\\tIn case of foreign contracts, finally approach the Government of the Supplier’s country through the Ministry of Defence, if needed', '\\n\\nApportionment of Quantity\\n\\nApportionment of Quantity: In global and limited tender enquiry cases, if there is an apprehension that the L1 may not have the capacity to supply the entire requisite quantity, it should be mentioned in the RFP that the order may be placed on L2, L3 and so on for the balance quantity at L1 rates, provided this is acceptable to them', ' Even if there was no prior decision to split the quantities and it is discovered that the quantity to be ordered is far more than what L1 alone can supply, the order may be distributed as above among L2, L3, etc', ' at the L1 rate', ' Where it is decided in advance to have more than one source of supply ( due to vital or critical nature of the item) the ratio of splitting should be indicated in the RFP', '\\n\\nAcceptance of Excess or Short Deliveries\\n\\n\\tAcceptance of Excess or Short Deliveries: There may be occasions when excess or short supplies are made by the vendors due to various reasons like, exact multiples of the standard units of measure, or where it is difficult to mention exact weight in case of steel plates etc', ' A clear indication should be made in the RFP if this clause is to be applied in any particular case', ' These variations in supplies may be accepted with the approval of CFA, subject to the value of such excess/short supplies not exceeding 5% (five percent) of the original value of the contract', ' CFA will be determined with reference to the value of the original order plus excess/short supply', '\\n\\n\\nBuy Back Offer\\n\\nBuy Back Offer: When it is decided to replace an existing old item(s) with a new item(s), a suitable clause should be incorporated in the RFP so that the prospective and interested bidders may formulate their bids accordingly', ' Depending on the value and condition of the old item(s) to be traded, the time as well as the mode of handing over of the old items to the successful bidder should be decided and relevant details in this regard suitably incorporated in the RFP', ' Suitable provision should also be made in the RFP to enable the Purchaser either to trade or not to trade the old item(s) while purchasing the new one(s)', \"\\n\\nFall Clause\\n\\n\\tFall Clause: In cases where contracts have to be concluded with the firms, whose rate contract with DGS&D/other central procurement agencies has expired and renewal of RC has not taken place, a 'fall clause' should be incorporated in the Supply Order/Contract to the effect that during the currency of the Supply Order/Contract, in case rates are found to be lower on conclusion of rate contract, the lower rates as in the rate contract shall be applicable\", '\\n\\n*******\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 RATE CONTRACT\\nGeneral\\n\\nObjective: The basic objective of a procurement agency is to provide the right items of right quality and in right quantity, at the right place and right price so as to meet the requirement of the users', ' One of the ways to ensure this is to conclude Rate Contracts for all common user items which are regularly required in bulk by the users and whose prices are likely to be stable and not subject to considerable market fluctuations', ' A Rate Contract (RC) enables procurement officers to procure indented items promptly and with economy of scale and also cuts down the order processing and inventory carrying cost', ' The RC system takes care of supply chain management and enables an efficient transaction both for the purchaser and the supplier', '\\n\\nDefinition: A Rate Contract (commonly known as RC) is an agreement between the purchaser and the supplier for supply of specified goods (and allied services if any) at specified price and terms & conditions (as incorporated in the agreement) during the period covered by the Rate Contract', ' No quantity is mentioned nor is any minimum drawal guaranteed in the Rate Contract', ' The Rate Contract is in the nature of a standing offer from the supplier firm', ' The firm and/or the purchaser is/are entitled to withdraw/cancel the Rate Contract by serving an appropriate notice on each other, of not less than thirty days', ' However, once a supply order is placed on the supplier for supply of a definite quantity in terms of the rate contract during the validity period of the rate contract that supply order becomes a valid and binding contract and the supplier is bound to supply the ordered quantity', '\\n\\nPrice Agreement: While procuring goods and services, it may be expedient to enter into a Price Agreement (PA)/Fixed Price Quotation (FPQ) with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)', ' The PA/FPQ may be finalized after due negotiation and market survey', ' Such PA/FPQ may be normally valid for a period upto three years and may be extended further suitably with next higher CFA’s sanction', '\\n\\nTypes of Items Suitable for RC: The types of items which may be considered for RC are:\\n\\nItems required by several users on recurring basis and having clear specifications', '\\n\\nFast moving items with short shelf life or storage constraints', '\\n\\n\\n\\nItems with minimum anticipated price fluctuation during the currency of the RC', ' Items with high probability of considerable price fluctuation should not be considered to be covered by RC except for short term contract', '\\n\\nItems that take long gestation period to manufacture and for which there is only one source for manufacturing', '\\n\\nItems already on DGS&D Rate Contract: No Rate Contract should normally be concluded for items in respect of which DGS&D Rate Contracts are already in place', ' If, however, it becomes necessary to enter into contracts for items which are already on DGS&D Rate Contract, the reasons for doing so should be recorded and CFA’s approval taken after consulting integrated finance', '\\n\\nAuthorities Competent to Conclude Rate Contract/Long Term Product Support\\n\\nAuthorities competent to conclude Rate Contracts: Rate Contract or Price Agreement for goods and services should be concluded only by the authorized Central and local Procurement Agencies', '\\n\\nLong Term Product Support: The Price Agreement for long term product support should be concluded with the approval of the authorities to whom such powers have been specifically delegated', '\\n\\nPeriod of Rate Contract\\n\\nPeriod of RC: A Rate Contract should normally be concluded for one year', ' However, in special cases, shorter or longer period, not exceeding three years, may be considered', ' Any extension of the existing RC or conclusion of an RC beyond a period of three years would need the approval of the Ministry of Defence', '\\nFixing of the Termination Period: As far as possible termination period of RC should be so fixed as to ensure that budgetary levies would not affect the price and thereby frustrate the contracts', '\\n\\nDetermination of the Competent Financial Authority to approve RC\\n\\nCompetent Financial Authority: Value of anticipated drawal over a period of one year should be taken into account while determining the level of CFA for conclusion of Rate Contract/Price Agreement', '\\n\\n\\nProcess of concluding Rate Contracts\\n\\nEstimate/Indent/Requisition: A Rate Contract can be concluded based on estimated annual requirements of various users under the authority processing an RC proposal', ' The contract concluding authority must scrutinize the estimates for their completeness in terms of authority for raising the indent, specification of the item, desired delivery schedule, packing and preservation, etc', ' Adequate budget provisions must be made and confirmed in the normal manner', '\\n\\nSelection of Firms: Rate Contracts should be normally concluded only with the registered firms based on their capacity assessment by the designated Registering/Inspecting Agency', ' In respect of new items being bought on Rate Contract for the first time, RC can be awarded to unregistered firms also on the basis of favourable technical capacity and financial capabilities', ' Past performance of a firm will be a major consideration while awarding a Rate Contract', ' The following aspects should normally be kept in mind:\\n\\nNo new RC should be placed with firms having backlog, which is likely to continue for major portion of the year', '\\n\\nPerformance of the contractor for the last 3 years should be taken into consideration', '\\n\\nIf the contractor does not have current RC, performance against earlier two immediate rate contracts should be considered', '\\n\\nIf the RC holder is a defaulter in furnishing drawal report, this should be looked into, if the defaulter is bidding', '\\n\\nThe minimum performance level / performance criteria should be specified in the bid documents', '\\n\\nPrice Negotiation: While concluding RC, it is preferable to conduct price negotiations by the CNC in order to obtain best value for money and also to clarify all aspects of the RC to avoid ambiguity and dispute at a later stage', ' All Rate Contracts and Price Agreements should be processed through the committee CFA or the CNC so as to ensure best value for money, quality assurance and transparency', ' Participation of finance member in all deliberations, particularly regarding the pricing and conditions of contract, is mandatory', '\\n\\nSigning of Rate Contract:   RC concluded for various wings of the MOD will be signed for and on behalf of the President of India', ' RC itself may be signed by the authority to whom powers to enter into RC are delegated or\\n\\n\\nan officer authorized to sign financial documents on his behalf, after CFA’s approval', '\\n\\nConclusion of Parallel RC\\n\\nParallel Rate Contracts: In case it is observed that a single supplier does not have enough capacity to cater to the entire demand of an item or where it is desirable to have a wider vendor base due to criticality of the items, it may become desirable to conclude parallel RCs with more than one firm', ' The CFA, based on the merit of each case, may decide the number of firms to be awarded RC for an item so that DDOs will have a wider choice', ' Efforts should be made to conclude parallel RCs with firms located in different parts of the country to cater to users over a wider geographical spread', ' Parallel RC may be concluded with marginal price difference say up to 5%', ' In such cases approval of the next higher CFA is to be taken', '\\n\\nAll DDOs to operate the RCs: Orders against a Rate Contract concluded by any authority may be placed on the same terms and conditions by all Direct Demanding Officers of Services/ Departments/ Organizations/Units/Establishments under the Ministry of Defence, subject to there being no downward trend in prices', '   To facilitate such operation, a suitable provision should be made in the RCs and the details of the RCs posted on the website of the Service/Organization concerned', '\\n\\nSpecial Conditions Applicable for Rate Contract\\n\\nSpecial Conditions: Some conditions of rate contract differ from the usual conditions applicable for other contracts', ' Some such important special conditions of rate contract are as follows:\\n\\nEarnest Money Deposit (EMD) is not applicable', '\\n\\nIn the Schedule of Requirement, no quantity is mentioned; only the anticipated drawal may be mentioned without any commitment', '\\n\\nThe purchaser reserves the right to conclude more than one rate contract for the same item', '\\n\\nThe purchaser as well as the supplier may withdraw the rate contract by serving suitable notice to each other', ' The prescribed notice period is generally thirty days', '\\n\\nThe purchaser has the option to renegotiate the price with the rate contract holders', '\\nIn case of emergency, the purchaser may purchase the same item through ad hoc contract with a new supplier', '\\n\\n\\n\\nUsually, the terms of delivery in rate contracts are FOR dispatching station', ' This is so, because the rate contracts are to take care of the users spread all over the country', ' However, wherever it is decided to enter into RCs which are FOR destination, the cost of transportation should be separately asked for', '\\n\\nSupply orders, incorporating definite quantity of goods to be supplied along with all other required conditions following the rate contract terms, are to be issued for obtaining supplies through the rate contract', '\\n\\nThe purchaser and the authorized users of the rate contract are entitled to place supply orders upto the last day of the validity of the rate contract and, though supplies against such supply orders will be effected beyond the validity period of the rate contract, all such supplies will be guided by the terms and conditions of the rate contract', '\\n\\nThe rate contract will be guided by “Fall Clause”', '\\n\\nFall Clause: Fall clause is a price safety mechanism in rate contracts', ' The fall clause provides that if the rate contract holder reduces its price or sells or even offers to sell the rate contracted goods following conditions of sale similar to those of the rate contract, at a price lower than the rate contract price, to any person or organization during the currency of the rate contract, the rate contract price will be automatically reduced with effect from that date for all the subsequent supplies under the rate contract and the rate contract amended accordingly', ' Other parallel rate contract holders, if any, are also to be given opportunity to reduce their price as well, by notifying the reduced price to them and giving them 15 (fifteen) days’ time to intimate their revised prices, if they so desire, in sealed cover to be opened in public on the specified date and time and further action taken as per standard practice', ' On many occasions, the parallel rate contract holders attempt to grab more orders by unethical means by announcing reduction of their price (after getting the rate contract) under the guise of Fall Clause', ' This situation is also to be dealt with in similar manner as mentioned earlier in this paragraph', ' It is, however, very necessary that the purchase organizations keep special watch on the performance of such rate contract holders who reduce their prices on one pretext or other', ' If their performances are not upto the mark, appropriately severe action should be taken against them including deregistering them, suspending business deals with them, terminating the contract, etc', '\\n\\nPerformance Security: Depending on the anticipated overall drawal against a rate contract and, also, anticipated number of parallel rate contracts to be issued for an item, the authority concluding the Rate Contract(s) may consider obtaining performance security of reasonable\\n\\n\\namount from the Rate Contract holders', ' A suitable clause to this effect is to be incorporated in the tender enquiry documents', ' Performance Security shall, however, not be demanded in the supply orders issued against rate contracts', '\\n\\nRenewal, Extension, Termination and Revocation of Contracts\\n\\nRenewal and Extension: It should be ensured that new rate contracts are made operative right after the expiry of the existing rate contracts without any gap for all rate contracted items', ' In case, however, it is not possible to conclude new rate contracts due to some special reasons, timely steps are to be taken to extend the existing rate contracts with same terms, conditions etc', ' for a suitable period, with the consent of the rate contract holders', ' Rate contracts of the firms, which do not agree to such extension, are to be left out of consideration for renewal and extension', ' Period of such extension should generally not be more than three months', ' Also, while extending the existing rate contracts, it shall be ensured that the price trend is not lower', '\\n\\nTermination and Revocation of RC: RC is in the nature of standing offer and a legal contract comes into being only when a supply order is placed by the CFA/Direct Demanding Officers', ' Being just a standing offer, embodying various terms of the offer, the contract holder may revoke it at any time during its currency', ' However, reasonable opportunity should be given to the supplier to represent against any revocation/cancellation of RC', '\\n\\nPayment\\n\\nPayment Terms: Standard Payment terms, as indicated below, should be incorporated in all Rate Contracts:-\\n\\n\\tUpto 95 % on receipt of stores at consignee’s premises against dispatch document, provisional receipt and copy number 1 of Inspection Note', ' However, in case it becomes essential to dispatch stores by train, 90% payment can be released against proof of dispatch, i', 'e', ', copy of the RR and inspection note', '\\n\\nBalance on accounting of stores by the consignee', '\\n\\n\\tPayment should be effected by the paying authority within 21 working days from the date of receipt of bill, if the supporting documents meet paying authority requirement', ' Consolidated observations, if any should be forwarded within 10 working days by paying authority to the CFA', '\\n\\n\\nPaying authority: The organization of the Principal Controller/ Controller of Defence Accounts concerned or an authority holding cash assignment/imprest and duly authorized to make payment for such procurements will be the paying authority', '\\n\\nFormat of the Supply Order\\n\\nFormat of the Supply Order: The format of the Supply Order on which the orders against Rate Contract could be placed by the Direct Demanding Officers is given in Appendix ‘F’', ' For DGS&D RC cases, FORM-131 of DGS&D may be used with suitable changes', '\\n\\n*******\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\nPROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND SERVICES FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nImport of spares and equipment from the revenue budget constitutes a sizeable portion of the overall defence expenditure', ' The Defence Services have been acquiring latest state-of-the-art equipment and weapon systems from various foreign countries', ' To ensure their serviceability at all times, it is essential that the spares and equipment support is provided at the right time, ensuring value for money spent', ' Hence, it is of paramount importance to lay down comprehensive procedures and policies in respect of foreign procurement in line with international procurement practices for implementation by all concerned with the process', ' While proposals for procurement of goods and services are also to be processed generally as per the procedure laid down in Chapter 5 of the Manual, some special features of procurements from abroad are explained in this Chapter', '\\n\\nIndents\\n\\nInformation to be given in the Indents: The process of procurement of stores commences only on receipt of indents, duly approved and authenticated by the competent authority', ' Every indent should contain the following information:-\\n\\nComplete details like part numbers and specifications of the equipment indented', '\\n\\nA realistic estimate of the cost with basis of assessment so that back references to the indenters is avoided', '\\n\\nWhere a demand is being indented for the first time, an indication to this effect', '\\n\\nWhen an item has been purchased

However, specific needs of the departments/wings are to be kept in mind and complied with', '\\n\\nSelection of vendor: A careful selection of the authorized and registered vendors is to be made for the range of spares listed in the Schedule of Requirement by the Procuring Agency for the purpose of issuing the RFP', ' Widening of the foreign vendor base is a multi-disciplinary and techno- commercial exercise', ' Registration of foreign OEMs and their authorized vendors / stockists should be undertaken as per laid down guidelines with the help of our Defence Attaché and Commercial Counselors in our Embassies / High Commissions abroad', '\\n\\nMode of Tendering\\n\\n\\tThe mode of tendering should be decided with regard to factors like, whether the stores / equipment are general

seek offers through their liaison', ' The RFP should also be posted on the Defence web site and that of the organization so that it could be downloaded by the prospective bidders for participating in the tender process', ' In cases of procurement of highly sensitive nature, which has national security implications, the tender documents are not to be posted on the web site', ' In such cases, specific reasons for not putting the RFP on the web site should be recorded while seeking CFA’s approval for the procurement proposal', '\\n\\nLimited Tender Enquiry: In all cases of foreign

and Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) Rules, 2000 framed by Government of India vide Notification No G', 'S', 'R', ' 381(E) dated 03 May 2000 and the directions issued by Reserve Bank of India under Foreign Exchange Management Act from time to time', '\\n\\nUniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits: Importer should follow normal banking procedures and adhere to the provisions of Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits (UCPDC) while opening Letters of Credit for import into India', '\\n\\nLetter Of Credit (LC) and the reasons for using them\\n\\tA letter of credit is a written understanding given by the buyer’s bank (the issuing bank) on behalf of and at the request of its customer (the applicant) routed through the agency of a bank in the seller’s country (advising bank) to the seller that it (issuing bank) guarantees to pay the seller for the goods within a specified time provided that the conditions laid down in documentary credit are fully satisfied', ' While an LC can be established in any of the 27 Public Sector banks besides SBI, it has been decided after careful consideration that for the present LCs may be opened only through the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank', ' The format for LC is given in Form DPM-12', '\\n\\nReasons for using LC: In international trade, buyer and seller being located in different countries may not know each other well', ' The two countries would have different legal systems, currencies and trade and exchange regulations', ' Due to this fact, both the Buyer and the Seller, need some conditions to be fulfilled, to suit their requirements, before releasing the payments and goods respectively', ' The buyer and seller want the following:\\n\\nA Seller would want:\\n\\nTo be paid as soon as he ships the goods', '\\n\\n\\nAn assurance that he will be paid by the buyer or his bank as per contractual obligations', '\\nConvenience of receiving payments in his own country', '\\n\\nA Buyer would want:\\n\\nTo pay for the goods only after they are shipped by the seller', '\\nAn assurance that the seller will ship the goods ordered for and deliver them in

'\\nIrrevocable letter of credit', '\\nConfirmed letter of credit', '\\nRevolving letter of credit\\n\\nRevocable Letter Of Credit: A revocable letter of credit is one which may be amended or cancelled by the issuing bank at any moment without prior notice to the beneficiary', ' Therefore, such a type of letter of credit does not give complete sense of security to the beneficiary', ' However, the notice of amendment or cancellation is effective only upon receipt of such notice by the advising bank', ' If the advising bank has undertaken liability (i', 'e', ' paid, negotiated or accepted) against documents, which appear on the face of it to be in conformity with the terms and conditions of the credit, before receiving notice of amendment/cancellation, the issuing Bank is bound to reimburse the advising bank', ' If the letter of credit is silent as to whether it is revocable or irrevocable, the credit is deemed to be irrevocable', '\\n\\n\\tIrrevocable Letter Of Credit: When the issuing Bank gives a definite, absolute and irrevocable undertaking to honour its obligations, provided the beneficiary complies with all the terms and conditions, such a credit is known as an irrevocable letter of credit', ' It means that the letter of credit cannot be amended, cancelled or revoked without the consent of the parties to the letter of credit', ' This gives the beneficiary a definite protection', '\\n\\nConfirmed Letter Of Credit: A confirmed letter of credit is one in respect of which another Bank in the beneficiary’s country adds its confirmation at the request of the issuing Bank', '   This undertaking of the confirming Bank to pay/ negotiate/accept is in addition to the undertaking of the issuing bank', ' This is an added protection to the beneficiary', ' This is not to be agreed to as it undermines the credibility of our Nationalized Banks', '\\n\\n\\n\\tRevolving Letter Of Credit: In such Letters of Credits, the amount is restored, after it has been utilized, to the original amount', ' Such credits are used when the buyer is to receive partial shipment of goods at specific intervals over a long duration', ' It can be cumulative or non-cumulative in nature', ' It avoids opening letter of credit for each and every consignment', '\\n\\nDivisible and non-divisible LCs: The above mentioned Letters of Credit could be divisible or non-divisible', ' Divisible Letters of Credit could be opened when more than one beneficiary is allowed and payment has to be made as per the consignment', '\\n\\nProcedure for Opening Letters of Credit and Working of the LC Mechanism\\n\\nOpening of Letters of Credit: The procedure for opening of an LC would generally include steps as given below: -\\n\\nStep-1: Receipt of PBG and intimation from the Supplier regarding readiness of goods for dispatch by the contract concluding authority as per contractual terms from the supplier', '\\n\\nStep-2: The contract concluding authority seeks FFE release from the appropriate authority', '\\n\\nStep-3: On release of FFE the contract concluding authority forwards the case for opening of LC to the Principal Controller/Controller of Defence Accounts concerned, who after proper scrutiny of all details for correctness, authorizes the bank to open the LC', ' The bank establishes the LC and intimates the Principal Controller/ Controller of Defence Accounts concerned and the contract concluding authority', '\\n\\n\\tPayment Through Letter of Credit: The letter of credit mechanism operates as follows:\\n\\nThe Buyer requests the issuing bank to open an LC', '\\n\\nThe Issuing Bank conveys LC through the Advising bank', '\\n\\nThe Advising bank advises the credit to the beneficiary', '\\n\\nThe Beneficiary, after complying with terms and conditions against stipulated documents, gets the value either from the Advising bank or the Nominated bank as per the terms of the LC', '\\nAfter passing on the value, the negotiating advising Bank claims reimbursement from the issuing Bank or nominated bank as per the terms of LC', '\\n\\n\\nUltimately, the issuing Bank recovers the amount from the applicant', ' It is the definite commitment of the issuing Bank to reimburse to the negotiating advising bank whether applicant provides the value of negotiation or not', '\\n\\nEssential Elements of LC\\n\\n\\tThe format of the Letter of Credit is given in Form DPM-12', ' Following essential elements are to be clearly stipulated while opening a Letter of Credit:\\n\\nType of LC\\nName and address of applicant and beneficiary\\nAmount of credit and currency\\nValidity of LC\\nLatest shipment date (delivery date as per contract)\\nBasis of delivery (FOB/FCA/CIP/CIF)\\nContract No', ' and date\\nShipment from

before initiating the case for extension of LC:\\n\\nExtension of delivery date in the contract and corresponding amendment in LC for latest date of shipment', '\\n\\nPerformance Bank Guarantee (PBG) extension', '\\nOnus of charges for LC extension', '\\n\\n\\tApprovals Required: An LC may be extended only with the prior concurrence of the IFA, where the LC was originally opened with the concurrence of integrated finance, and approval of the CFA', '\\n\\nDirect Bank Transfer\\n\\nDirect Bank Transfer (DBT): A transferable credit is a credit under which the Beneficiary may request the bank authorized to pay, incur a deferred payment undertaking, accept or negotiate or in the case of a freely negotiable credit, the bank specifically authorized in the credit as a transferring bank to make the credit available in whole or in part to one or more than one beneficiaries', ' Direct Bank Transfer shows high degree of\\n\\n\\ntrust between parties', ' Buyer ensures that the payment is released only after receipt of the documents listed in paragraph 12', '6', '1 and confirmation from the Supplier that one set of the documents has been sent to the port consignee immediately after dispatch of the stores', '\\n\\nAdvice to the Principal Controller/Controller: After obtaining the above mentioned documents, the details of which should form part of the contract, the contract concluding authority advises the Principal Controller/ Controller of Defence Accounts concerned to effect Direct Bank Transfer', ' The Principal Controller/Controller concerned, in turn, authorizes the Buyer’s bank to make direct transfer of funds to the Seller’s bank account', '\\n\\n\\tAdvantages of DBT: In comparison with payments through Letters of Credit, payment through DBT has the following advantages:\\n\\nPayment is released only after receipt of goods', '\\n\\nPayment is made only after full satisfaction to the quality, quantity etc', '\\n\\nIt is cost-effective as compared with LCs', '\\n\\n\\tDBT for Contracts below USD 1,00,000: For contracts below USD 100,000 DBT payment terms should be insisted upon at the time of concluding the contract', '\\n\\nDelivery Schedules\\n\\tDelivery of goods: The normal schedule for delivery of goods in case of LC and DBT payment terms should be as follows:\\n\\nL/C Payments: Six months from the date of signing of the

'\\n\\nIn case the spares under procurement are in large quantity or their technical production cycle is long as specified by the seller in the\\n\\n\\nRFP, the LC shall be opened for more than one quarter as per the terms of the contract', '\\n\\nDBT Payments: Preferably within three months of the signing of the contract\\n\\nPerformance Bank Guarantee (PBG)\\n\\nDefinition: PBG is a written undertaking obtained from the Supplier through his bank as a guarantee that he would perform the promise/terms and conditions of the contract and to ensure the discharge of liability of the Supplier in case of his default', ' The guidelines and format of performance bank guarantee are given in Forms DPM-14 and DPM-15 respectively', '\\n\\nEssential Elements of PBG: The essential elements of PBG are as follows:\\n\\nAmount\\nAddress of the Beneficiary, Applicant and the Bank\\nValidity date\\nContract Number and Date\\n\\nGuarantees\\n\\nThe salient features of Guarantees are as

be further confirmed by any Public Sector Bank or private bank duly authorized to conduct government transactions', '\\n\\n* ICICI Bank Ltd', ', Axis Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd are at present the private sector banks authorized to conduct government transactions', ' IDBI Bank Ltd has been converted into a Public Sector Bank', '\\n\\n\\n*******\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nEVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS AND PRICE REASONABILITY\\nIntroduction\\n\\nCost Estimation: Correct estimation of rates/cost is vital for determining the CFA and establishing the reasonability of the offers received from the suppliers', ' It is, therefore, important that the rates/cost are worked out in a realistic, objective and professional manner on the basis of the prevailing market rates, last purchase price, economic indices for raw material/labour, other input costs and assessment based on intrinsic value etc', ' It is equally important to evaluate the quotations/offers received in response to the RFP correctly to select the best offer', ' This Chapter contains guidelines for assessment of rates/cost, evaluation of quotations and determining price reasonability', '\\n\\nCosting of Procurement Proposals\\n\\n\\tNeed for costing: The first stage at which costing needs to be done is when the proposal is initiated by the Procuring Agency', ' It is necessary to work out the complete cost of a procurement proposal to determine availability of funds to meet the expected cash outflow and the level at which it would need to be approved', ' It is, therefore, essential that the cost is assessed realistically and comprehensively', ' The entire, all inclusive assessed cost should be the basis for determining the CFA', '\\n\\nBasis of costing: The cost of a procurement proposal may be assessed on the basis of the Last Purchase Price (LPP), Professional Officers’ Valuation (POV), Budgetary Quote (BQ) to be obtained from one or more prospective sellers, Market Survey (MS), or any other method as may be appropriate in the context of a particular purchase proposal', ' These methods are not mutually exclusive', ' The method of costing should be clearly recorded while seeking CFA’s approval', '\\n\\nCost to be worked out in INR: Wherever applicable, the assessed cost should be converted into the common denomination of Indian Rupees (INR) and shown both in terms of the foreign currency and INR while seeking CFA’s approval', ' The exchange rate adopted should be as on the date of opening of the price bids', ' The conversion factor should be clearly indicated', ' The method of conversion is given in this Chapter', '\\n\\n\\nEvaluation of Quote\\n\\nEvaluating financial implication of offers: While RFP is issued on the basis of the assessed cost, as approved by the CFA, the next important stage in the process is the stage at which the bids received in response to the RFP are required to be evaluated to work out the total financial implication and reasonability of each offer', ' The first step in arriving at the decision regarding reasonability of price or otherwise is to determine the exact cost of the proposal', ' In order to ensure that all offers are compared in an equitable and fair manner and the vendors are provided a level playing field, all elements of cost, including the terms and conditions with financial implications are to be taken into account', ' The criteria to be adopted for this purpose should be indicated in the RFP and the quotations should be ranked as per those criteria', ' In the case of medical equipment where five years warranty/guarantee is provided for, firms may be asked to quote comprehensive AMC rates for five years on expiry of warranty/ guarantee and these may be loaded in CST and taken into consideration while deciding the L1 vendor', ' However, this evaluation criterion would be clearly indicated in the RFP in such cases', '\\n\\n\\tBasis of comparison of cost: The basis for comparison of cost in different situations would be as follows:\\n\\nWhen the competition is only among the Indian Suppliers, the F', 'O', 'R Prices at destination (Consignee’s premises) should be the basis for ranking of quotations', '\\n\\nIf the competition is amongst foreign suppliers, the basis for comparison should be the landed price at the destination (designated port) only', '\\n\\nWhen the competition is amongst indigenous and foreign suppliers, the basic cost (CIF) quoted by the foreign suppliers should be the basis for comparison with the basic cost offered by the indigenous suppliers, after offloading the Excise Duty (ED), Central Sales Tax/VAT and other local taxes and levies', ' The term ‘indigenous supplier’ would include Defence PSUs and the Indian Ordnance Factories (OFs)', '\\n\\nDetermining CIF cost: When the quotations of foreign vendors are also to be compared with the quotation of indigenous suppliers, CIF cost of foreign supplier is to be taken into account but difficulty arises when only FOB/FCA cost is indicated by a foreign supplier', ' There cannot be any standard formula for arriving at the CIF value in such cases', ' It would not be desirable to add a notional additional cost as a percentage of FOB/FCA cost to arrive at the CIF cost', ' To avoid a situation like this, it should be clearly indicated in the RFP that the foreign vendors should indicate the CIF cost', '\\n\\n\\n\\nComparative Statement of Tenders: On receipt of all accepted tenders, the Procuring Agency should collate them in the form of a Comparative Statement of Tenders (CST)', ' The prices quoted in foreign currencies should be converted into INR indicated in the CST', ' The rate of conversion of foreign currency into INR prevailing on the date of opening of the price bid may be taken into account for converting the quoted price into INR', ' The rate can be obtained from SBI Parliament Street, New Delhi', ' The CST should be exhaustive and it must include all details given in the quotations', '   Any deviation from the tender documents is to be brought out in the CST', ' LPP, wherever available, should be indicated in the CST for a fair comparison of the offered prices', ' The purchase officer should sign the CST and it should be vetted and countersigned by the IFA/IFA’s representative with regard to original quotations, indents and other supporting documents, where financial powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance', '\\n\\nDetermination of lowest acceptable offer: What would be done on the file is the preparation of comparative statement, checking of calculations, the premises on which the comparative statement of tenders has been prepared and prima facie determination of L1 offer', ' However, it would be the CNC only which will finally determine the lowest acceptable offer (L1 vendor)', '\\n\\n\\tNegotiations and benchmarking: In multi-vendor cases, on opening of commercial offers, once L1 vendor is identified, the contract should be concluded with him and there would be no need for any further price negotiations', ' However, negotiations can be held in exceptional circumstances where valid logical reasons exist and such negotiations should be held only with L1', ' The exceptional situations include procurement of proprietary items, items with limited sources of supply and items where there is suspicion of cartel formation', ' The justification and details of such negotiations should however be duly recorded and documented without loss of time and convincing reasons must be recorded by the authority recommending the negotiation', ' Negotiations through a CNC/PNC should be conducted in case of single tender situations including PAC cases', ' Negotiations may also have to be conducted in multi-vendor cases where the offered price is considered high with reference to the assessed reasonable price taking into account inter alia, the competition observed from the response of the trade to the inquiry', ' In each case the CNC/PNC should record its recommendations regarding the reasonableness of the price offered by the L1 bidder and the need for negotiation or otherwise with detailed justification', ' Based on the recommendation of TPC/CNC/PNC, negotiation may be undertaken in consultation with the Integrated Finance and approval of the CFA', ' In cases where a decision is taken to go for re-tendering, but the\\n\\n\\nrequirements are urgent, negotiations may be under taken with L1 bidder(s) for the supply of a bare minimum quantity in accordance with para 3 of CVC instructions dated 3rd March 2006 (not reproduced in this Manual)', '\\n\\nBench Marking: Before scheduled negotiation, (wherever considered necessary), it would be advisable to work out the estimated reasonable rate or the benchmark, to judge acceptability of the L1 offer based on available information', ' The approach to be adopted for assessing reasonability in different contingencies is given below', '\\n\\n\\nReasonableness of Prices in Competitive Tendering\\n\\n\\tDetermining Reasonability of Prices: In the case of competitive tendering where two or more vendors are competing independently to secure a contract, the competitive bids form the basis for determining reasonableness of prices', ' Database maintained on cost, based on concluded contracts, price of the product available through market, etc', ' should also be used to assess reasonableness of the price offered', '\\n\\nEvaluation of tenders is to be made on the basis of the ultimate cost to the user', '\\n\\nAs a general principle, no offer involving any uncertain or indefinite liability or any condition of unusual character should be considered', '\\n\\nThe reasonableness of the price proposed has to be established by taking into account the competition observed from the response of the trade to the enquiry, last purchase price, estimated value as given in the indent, database maintained on costs based on the past contracts entered into, market price, wherever available and changes in the indices of various raw materials, electricity, whole sale price index, and statutory changes in wages, rates etc', '\\n\\nFor procurement of spare parts, consumables and small value contracts which are supplied in the past, the price reasonableness can be determined after comparing with last purchase price and factoring in changes in price indices published by the Government sources', '\\n\\nThe reasonableness of price may also be examined by resorting to Cost Analysis in situations where there is a wide variance over the LPP, not explained by corresponding changes in indices', '\\n\\nEffort should be made to check cost break up details as per format of cost-analysis given in Form DPM-25, to the extent possible', '\\n\\n\\nLast Purchase Price (LPP)\\n\\nLast Purchase Price as a determinant of reasonable price: LPP is one of the relevant factors in deciding price reasonableness', ' However, following needs to be considered while comparing the quoted rates with the LPP:\\n\\nLPP of more than three years vintage is not a real scale for comparison', ' However, such LPP could be used as an input for assessing the rates by adding yearly escalation, if considered necessary', ' The rate of escalation may differ from case to case depending on the type of goods being procured', ' This escalation factor should be carefully worked out on the basis of data of past purchases of the same/similar items or as per the Pricing Policy Agreements, if any', ' The escalation factor should be worked out by Procuring Agencies of the Services after mutual consultation so that different escalation factors are not applied by different Procuring Agencies for the same/ similar items and in respect of the same source or should be worked out as per pricing policy where such pricing IGA is in place', '\\n\\nLPP should pertain to a past successfully executed order of similar magnitude and scope of supply', '\\n\\nFactors like basket price and bulk discount offered need to be taken in to account while using LPP as a scale for comparing prices', '\\n\\nPrice variation clause, if any, and the final cost paid by the user in respect of last purchase to which LPP pertains needs to be considered', '\\n\\nFactors like items supplied against LPP being of current production or ex-stock supply need to be taken into account', '\\n\\nMarket conditions and other factors like re-starting production lines due to obsolescence may also have to be considered', '\\n\\nWhere no other option to assess reasonable rate is feasible, LPP of more than three year vintage may also be taken into account but such situations should be rare', '\\n\\nAdoption of Discounted Cash Flow Technique (DCF)\\n\\n\\tDiscounted Cash Flow: The Discounted Cash Flow is defined in the Glossary of Management Accounting Terms, published by the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants of India, as “the method of evaluation by which cash flow of the future are discounted to current levels by the application of a discount rate with a view to reducing all cash flow to common denomination and make comparison”', ' DCF is also defined as “a\\n\\n\\nmethod of investment appraisal under which today’s cash outflows are compared with today’s cash inflows”\\n\\nNet Present Value Analysis: The Net Present Value (NPV) is a variant of DCF method, which is to be used for evaluation of tender', ' The NPV of a contract is equal to the sum of the present values of all the cash flows associated with it', ' The following formula is to be used for calculating NPV of a tender bid:\\n\\nNPV = \\uf053 _An_\\n(1+i)t\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\nNPV\\t= Net Present Value\\nA\\t= Expected cash flow for the period mentioned by the subscript I\\t= Rate of interest or discounting factor\\nT\\t= The period after which payment is done\\nN\\t= Payment Schedule as per the payment terms and conditions\\n\\nWhen choosing among the various bids for the contract, the bid with the lowest NPV should be selected', '\\n\\n\\tSteps involved in NPV: The application of NPV analysis in defence procurement would involve the following five steps:\\n\\nStep 1: Selection of the discount rate\\nStep 2: Identifying the cash out flows to be considered in the analysis Step 3: Establishing the timing of the cash outflow\\nStep 4: calculating the NPV of each alternative Step 5: Selecting the offer with the least NPV\\nDiscounting Rate: Discounting rate to be used under the method is to be the lending rate of the Government of India on loans given to the State Governments', ' These rates are notified by the Budget Division of Ministry of Finance annually', '\\n\\nModels for structuring cash flows: Following are the suitable models for structuring cash flows for tenders/bids:\\n\\n\\nStructuring cash flows for tenders/bids received in the same currency\\n\\nThe first step would be to exclude the unknown variables like escalation factors etc while determining the cash flows', '\\n\\nThereafter the cash out flow expected as per the contract schedule from different tenders should be taken into consideration and where the cash out flows are not available from the tender documents, the same should be obtained from the vendors', '\\n\\nOnce the out flows of different tenders become available, NPV of different tenders is to be calculated using the formula given above and the one with the lowest NPV is to be selected', '\\n\\nStructuring cash flows for tenders/bids received in different currencies\\n\\nWhere bids are received in different currencies/combination of currencies, the cash out flow may be brought to a common denomination in rupees by adopting a base exchange rate as on the day of opening of price bid', ' Thereafter, the procedure as described above in the case of tender bids received in the same currency should be applied to arrive at NPV', ' Conversion of foreign currency bid into rupees is to be done by taking into account the BC selling rate of the Parliament Street Branch of State Bank of India, New Delhi on the date of the opening of the Price bid', '\\n\\nAny standard software, pre-loaded as part of a personal computer could be used for NPV analysis', '\\n\\nWhen is the DCF to be used?: The alternative with the smallest payment of net present value in the procurement is the obvious choice', ' The DCF may be made use of to facilitate determination of L1 in following procurement situations:\\n\\nTo compare different payment terms of the vendors to a common denomination for determining L1 status', '\\n\\nTo deal with the cases where entering into AMC over a period of 10 to 11 years is part of the contract for evaluating for L1 status', '\\n\\n\\tDetermination by adding Arithmetic Values: Determination of L1 by merely adding arithmetic values spread over 12 to 13 years (2 years warranty and 10 to 11 year AMC) would be an incorrect procedure for determining L1 and the correct procedure would be to reduce cash out flows into present values through the DCF technique, for which the discount rate to be adopted should form part of the RFP', '\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalysis of offers from Foreign Suppliers\\n\\n(Analysis of offers: Apart from the parameters enumerated earlier in this Chapter regarding analysis, cost break up and price indices wherever feasible, efforts should be made to analyze:\\n\\nThe price fixation procedure/methodology prevailing in the country of the vendor', '\\n\\nThe prices of similar products, systems and subsystems wherever available should be referred', ' The database maintained in the respective division connected with the procurement of such type of stores should be accessed', '\\n\\n2 The foreign vendor may be asked to provide the details of past supplies and contract rates, if any, of similar kind of product to other buyers', ' DRDO and Production Agencies should be involved in assessing the reasonability of prices in such cases of high value', '\\n\\nData Base to be maintained\\n\\nData Base on Cost & Prices: Each service HQrs, should ideally have a costing expert who would advise on reasonableness of price, escalation clauses, cost verification where prices are fixed subject to a ceiling price', ' Service HQrs, OFB and DRDO should maintain data base on past contracts showing details of items procured, their essential spec(s), unit rate, quantity, total value, mode of TE, number of tenders received, number of tenders considered acceptable, reasons for exclusion of overlooked tenders, un-negotiated rates of L1 and contract rates in order to help in ascertaining reasonability of prices of future procurements', '\\n\\nPrice Indices: For price indices, internet should be accessed by officers dealing with purchases/associated with CNC from important sites', ' In regard to price indices of indigenous items, website of Ministry of Industry  HYPERLINK \"http://www', 'eaindustry', 'nic', 'in/\"  \\\\h www', 'eaindustry', 'nic', 'in should be accessed for the latest indices/trends', ' For metals and other minerals access  HYPERLINK \"http://www',

Sector Banks, particularly SBI, may be consulted before firming up major payments involving LC, Performance Bank Guarantee, reputation of foreign banks etc', '\\n\\n\\tGeneral Analysis of Financial/Cost Ratios: In assessing the reasonableness, general analysis of Financial/Cost ratios from published accounts and evaluation of Commercial/Technical information of the Vendor/Bidder may be undertaken', ' The allocation of overheads should be as per established principles of costing', ' Assessment should be made on the vendor’s approach to controlling cost, adherence to delivery schedule, Cost Accounting System and other factors affecting contractor’s ability to meet cost/schedule targets', '\\n\\nData Sharing: The Service Headquarters must put in place a system for data sharing and data networking, both within the Service and among the Services in order to widen the procurement sources and obviate different prices being paid for the same item by different Procuring Agencies within a Service or Procuring Agencies of different Services', '\\n\\nTransparency in assessment process: Assessing of reasonableness of price is an arduous task, especially where price data is not available or in case of overseas purchases', ' In such cases, it is important to place on record efforts made for arriving at the acceptable price and taking the procurement decision', '\\n\\n\\n*******\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nOFFLOADING OF PARTIAL/ COMPLETE REFITS/REPAIRS OF SHIPS/ SUBMARINES/CRAFTS/ASSETS TO INDIAN PSU/PRIVATE SHIP YARDS/TRADE\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\tA ship/submarine is a platform that consists of an assortment of weapons, sensors and support systems, along with propulsion, power generation and auxiliary systems, facilities for crew and fuel and provisions', ' All the surveillance and weapon systems are interlinked and integrated through an elaborate data management system', ' The platform as a whole or a part thereof is required to be refitted/repaired from time to time, including inter alia, disassembly, docking, inspection/survey, repair/overhaul followed by trials in harbour and at sea', ' As an integral part of the refit process, approved modifications to structure, equipment, machinery and systems including installation of new equipment are also carried out', ' Overall, the partial /complete refit of a ship/submarine/ yard craft is a complex activity, wherein concerted planning is required much before the commencement of the repairs/refit and also during the course of the repairs/refit to ensure completion in a time bound manner and make the platform seaworthy and battle worthy', ' Repair of Marine Assets/Service Assets also involve the same kind of planning as required for undertaking repairs/refits of Ships/Submarines', ' The entire activity is different from other revenue procurement activity, such as, procurement of goods and stores or even other services, since a number of technical issues are required to be addressed, including visits by the bidders to the ship/submarine /assets to be repaired/ refitted', ' For the purpose of clarity, the following definitions would be used in respect of ships/submarines/crafts/assets and their associated repairs/refits:-\\n\\nRefit: Includes all activities towards servicing of equipment/refurbishment/ renovation/modification including inter alia planned dry docking to attain designed/stated performance', '\\n\\nRepair: Includes all activities, where a defect/anomaly in performance/degradation in performance of equipment necessitates remedial measures on the stated equipment', '\\nMarine Assets:    All assets including yard crafts, boats, barges (both dumb and self propelled), Battle Practice Targets (BPTs), Pontoons, Catamarans, Floating Dry Docks, Dock Gates, Caissons, Flap Gates, etc which come in direct contact with the Marine Environment are Marine Assets', '\\n\\n\\nService Assets: All assets other than Marine Assets including Jetty Cranes, Mobile Cranes, Listers, Trailors, Mobile Generators, Mobile Chilling Plants, Forklifts, Workshop Machinery, etc, non-availability of which either directly or indirectly affect the productivity of a unit are Service Assets', '\\nCompetent Technical Authority(CTA): The CTA is the head of the Service Repair Agency under the relevant CFA', '\\nService Repair Agency', ' The agency of the Navy/Coast Guard whose job is to execute the maintenance and/or the maintenance policy of the ship/submarine/yard craft\\nPost Defectation Demand (PDD) Spares', ' The spares required for completion of repairs/refit, which are evident only upon opening up/dismantling of the equipment/system and can normally not be foreseen at the time of formulation of scope of work', '\\nAim\\n\\nThe aim of this chapter is to lay down guidelines for offloading of partial/complete repairs/refits of ships/submarines/ assets to Indian PSU/Private ship repair yards/trade owing to the unique nature of repairs/refits necessitating a distinct procedure', ' The succeeding paragraphs enumerate the detailed guidelines to be followed in the refits/repairs of ships/submarines/crafts and the procedure for repair of all Marine/Service assets', '\\n\\nPreamble\\n\\n Refits of Ships/Submarines', '    Refits of ships/submarines are scheduled in accordance with the Ops-cum-Refit cycles promulgated for each class of ship', ' The refit schedules for a Two – Three year period (as the case may be for CG and Navy, respectively) are decided during the Annual Refit Conference (ARC) chaired by COM (Navy) and PDFM (CGHQ), respectively', ' The proposals for off loading of refits due to constraint of capacity/expertise are discussed and approved during the ARC', '\\n\\nTendering:   All partially/ fully off loaded refits/repairs may be undertaken on OTE/LTE basis', ' To save hidden costs on fuel consumption, administrative expenses, support infrastructure requirements, etc in offloading the refit/repair work to shipyards located away from the base port, LTE to the shipyards in the immediate geographical vicinity of the ship’s base and those shipyards willing to undertake the refit in such vicinity, may be considered', ' In case, the response from these shipyards is poor, quotes may be invited from other shipyards to undertake the repairs/refits at the location specified by the Customer', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOff loading of Partial/Complete Refits/Repairs of Ships/Submarines\\n\\n\\tProcedure', ' The stages involved in offloading of partial/ complete repairs/refit of ships/submarines are enumerated in the succeeding paragraphs', '\\n\\nConsolidated AON', ' The Service Repair Agency would put up a comprehensive plan for offloading that will include the following:-\\n\\nCases approved for off-loading during ARC', '\\nSchedule of Refits being off-loaded', '\\nRough Indicative Cost (RIC) of approved cases', '\\n\\nOffloading Plan', ' The cases for off-loading will be consolidated into the offloading plan with the under mentioned parts', ' The off loading plan (Roll- On Basis) would serve as an indicator of the estimated spread of expenditure and anticipated budget requirement for the next two to three years', '\\n\\nPart A', ' Consolidated cases that would individually be processed under delegated powers of ASDs/CSY/COMDISs for the ensuing year', '\\nPart B', ' Consolidated cases that would individually be processed under delegated powers of CinCs/COMCGs for the next two years', '\\nPart C', ' Consolidated cases that would individually be processed under delegated powers of VCNS/DGICG for the next two/three years', '\\nPart D', ' Consolidated cases that would individually be processed under delegated powers of MoD for the next two/three years in

Electrical & Weapon Work Package\\nMajor Hull Work Package\\nMajor Equipment Replacement/upgradation\\nServices\\nMaterial and Spares\\n\\n\\n\\nThe AON for the offloading plan would be accorded by the CFA based on the financial implication of the individual cases', ' For instance, the AON for Part B of the offloading plan would be accorded by the respective CinC/COMCG (even if the consolidated financial implications exceed the delegated financial powers)', ' The financial consultation for each part of the offloading plan would be given by the concerned IFA of respective CFA', ' The AON would be accorded for the cases to be processed at the indicated cost and valid for the period of consolidation on a roll-on basis', ' On accord of AON for the entire offloading plan, the same would be forwarded to all concerned CFAs and IFAs for record by Navy/Coast Guard', ' The AON would be accorded for the Standard RFP and SCOC placed at Appendix G and Appendix H', '   The work package should be firmed up prior to issuance of the RFP, in order to incorporate a realistic estimate of Scope of Work', '\\n\\n\\tAfter the accord of AON, the RFP for individual cases, with firmed up work package, would be issued by the respective Service Repair Agencies, as and when due', ' The Scope of Work (SOW) would be enclosed with the RFP', ' The RFP would be issued by the CFA or by the agency (which may be NDs/NSRYs in the case of Navy) and (BMUs/Station HQs/DHQs/RHQs in the case of Coast Guard) duly authorised in writing by the CFA', '\\n\\n\\tIn case of any deviation from the standard RFP or upward revision of the estimated cost, the case along with the revised draft RFP would be forwarded for vetting and approval of CFA in consultation with IFA where required as per delegation of financial powers', ' Variations from Standard RFP and SCOC for individual cases can still be part of the Roll-On Plan, in which case, those specific cases are to be accorded separate AONs along with the variations in the RFP and SCOC', '\\n\\n\\tAll emergent cases due to service exigencies may be taken up for AON of he CFA separately', ' In such cases, if the financial implication of the off loading case is beyond the powers of the immediate CFA, then the SOC along with the draft RFP will be sent directly to the next higher CFA duly recommended for vetting and approval', ' Concurrence of the intermediate IFA is not required, as the case would be dealt with exclusively by the next higher IFA', '\\n\\nReceipt and Processing of Bids\\n\\n Pre Bid Conference', ' Pre-bid discussions may be held prior to submission of bids for clarification of issues related to the SOW', ' However where the repair/refit project involves firming up of technical issues prior to issue of RFP, in such cases, a Request for Information (RFI) Conference may be held with prospective Tenderers followed by issue of a formal RFP', '\\n\\n\\nThe RFP would be issued only to those vendors who satisfy the pre- qualification criterion', '\\n\\n TEC', ' On submission of the bids, the TEC would be conducted by the agency nominated by the CFA and the TEC report is to be forwarded to the CFA', ' The TEC is not authorized to discuss commercial aspects of the case', ' However, the TEC should prepare a compliance statement in respect of commercial terms and conditions, such as bid security, warranty, etc', ' included in the technical bid as per the RFP', ' While IFA need not participate in the TEC, CFA may, if considered necessary, evolve a system of associating the IFA or his representative in examination of the TEC report in regard to compliance with the commercial terms and conditions before opening of price/ ‘Q’ Bids', '\\n\\nProcessing of ‘T’ Bid', ' The off loading case will thereafter be processed concurrently for the following:-\\n\\nApproval of TEC Report', '\\n\\nComposition of Tender Opening Committee (TOC) for opening ‘Q’ Bids', '\\n\\n Processing of Price Bid', ' The TOC will

in Paras in 14', '4 to\\n14', '5 above, except that the offloading plan in the case of Marine/Service assets would be annual', '\\n\\n\\nCharacteristic Features of Refits/Repair\\nGrowth of Work', ' The SOW in refits of ships/submarines are usually non- deterministic and dynamic in nature with regard to resources required for completion', ' The growth of work, a feature typical of refits/repairs, is dependent inter alia on factors such as Age of Ship/Submarine, Condition of onboard Equipment/machinery, Condition of Hull, role and exploitation pattern, duration between formulation of work package and actual execution of work, modifications and Additions & Alterations', ' Additional financial sanction up to 15% of Contract Value would be catered for such Growth of Work', ' Payment in all such cases will be made at actuals subject to the respective ceiling stipulated for the Navy and Coast Guard', ' A Post Refit Report would be drawn up for distribution to all concerned including the IFA', '\\n\\nNote:    In case of Coast Guard, the present practice is to allow a component up to 15% of Contract Value towards Growth of Work and up to 20% of Contract Value towards Non-available Spares', ' This practice may continue for the present', '\\nGrowth of work would be costed on pro-rata costs quoted by the Bidder and accepted during CNC', ' Wherever, pro-rata rates are not available, the prices would be negotiated by the COA in consultation with the IFA', '\\nPayment Terms\\nStages of Payment', ' The Stage Payments are to be specified in the RFP for complete/partial offloading of repairs/refit and are to be commensurate with the work undertaken by the yard', ' The number of stages and payment terms would vary from case to case depending on duration of the project and cost involved and are to be incorporated in the RFP', ' The recommended stage payment terms for complete refit may be as follows:-\\n\\n\\nRefit Cost\\n\\nStage – I', ' 10% advance of basic contracted refit cost against bank guarantee / indemnity bond (in case of DPSUs) on placement of order/contract', '\\n\\nStage – II', ' 10% of the basic contracted refit cost on docking (excluding taxes and Growth of Work)\\n\\nStage – III', ' 20% of the basic contracted refit cost on final undocking and completion of all under water works\\n\\n\\nStage IV', ' 20% of the basic contracted refit cost on satisfactory completion of Basin Trials and harbour trials of major machinery/ equipment (such as Main Propulsion Plant, Shafting and equipment related to Habitability)\\n\\nStage – V', ' 20% of the basic contracted refit cost minus cost of all incomplete work on satisfactory completion of post refit Sea trials and departure of the ship from the shipyard', ' Cost of incomplete work will be withheld till completion of work', '\\n\\nStage VI', ' Balance along with cost for Growth of Work and taxes on submission of final bill within sixty (60) days on satisfactory completion of Refit', ' Shipyard to provide a bank guarantee equal to 10% of the final cost of refit/repair (indemnity bond in case of DPSUs), which should be valid till the completion of the guarantee/warranty period', '\\n\\nNote:- All stage and final bill payments are to be vetted and cleared by COA', '\\n\\nMaterial and Spares', ' Advance on signing of Contract of up to 10% of cost of spares, against Bank Guarantee may be permitted', ' The remaining payment for spares would be made along with the stage payments during refit duration, on submission of proof of Purchase order, Material receipt and Inward inspection', ' Handling charges, if any, are to be restricted to a maximum of 7', '5%', '\\n\\nLoading in Case of Defect List Items “Not Quoted”', ' In order to ensure that all offers are compared in an equitable and fair manner, loading would be resorted to for determining the L1', ' During this process the bids with unresponsive sections/sub-sections would be loaded by the amount quoted by the highest bidder for that particular section/sub-section for preparing CST', ' The Bid shall be deemed to be responsive only if the firm accepts the loading in writing', '\\n Criterion for Determination of L1 Firm', ' The L1 Firm would be determined as follows:-\\nNavy', ' The Cost of Refit, Services and Budgetary Cost of Spares listed in the work package would be taken into account for determination of L1', ' Payment for such mandatory spares shall not exceed the budgetary cost given in the ‘Q’ bid', '\\nCoast Guard', ' In case of Coast Guard, since mandatory spares are not part of Refit Package, determination of L1 Firm would be considered on account of Cost of Refit inclusive of Services', '\\n\\n\\nRequest for Proposal', ' The repairs/refits of ships/submarines/assets are distinct from other procurement cases and warrant a separate standardised RFP (placed at Appendix G)', '\\nStandard Conditions of Contract', ' Standard Conditions of Contract (SCoC) owing to distinct nature of such

changes/amendments to the Contract', '\\n\\n\\n******\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\nDESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND FABRICATION CONTRACTS\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nGeneral', ' This Chapter lays down the procedures to be followed by the Defence authorities and Departments for conclusion of contracts for design, indigenous development (including indigenization) and fabrication of stores, equipment and spares required by the Defence Services', ' The general instructions contained herein have been made as flexible as possible to avoid time delays and to encourage the industry to come forward and undertake the design, development and fabrication of items, equipment, plant and machinery required by the Defence Services', ' Detailed Instructions on Procedures to be followed in-house for processing orders for items of a developmental nature/indigenisation may be drawn by the Services HQrs/ other development agencies like DRDO, CPOs etc', ' in consultation with the MoD (Finance) in broad consonance with the guidelines contained herein', '\\n\\nDecision for Indigenous Development', ' The Technical Directorate/ Directorate of Indigenisation /Committee for Indigenisation of the concerned Service/ Department/ Command HQ should assess the economic viability of indigenous manufacture of a defence item in the civil sector in terms of volume, likelihood of future requirement and economies of scale, residual life of the equipment/item and a clear indication of requirement over a long period (of say 3-5 years)', ' For this purpose necessary systemic changes in planning and provisioning may be carried out by the Services', ' In case the above conditions are not fulfilled, the feasibility of indigenising a package of similar range of items may be considered / decided by the CFA in consultation with the IFA keeping in view the volume, future requirement and economies of scale so as to make the package commercially viable', ' If it is not feasible to work out a package but the item is still required to be indigenised for strategic reasons, the requirement may be projected to the Department of Defence Production and Supplies for development by the OFB/Defence PSUs etc', ' where feasible', '\\n\\nPartnership with Private Sector', ' The Indian private sector Industry today offers scope for their greater involvement in the Defence Sector and possesses the requisite skills and infrastructure for undertaking defence production or may be willing to invest/share the cost of setting up of such infrastructure', ' The industry should be encouraged to make such investment by working out the Minimum Order Quantity to maintain the financial viability of development within the desired time\\n\\n\\nschedules', ' As regards high technology complex systems, projects under this category should be identified, to be undertaken by Raksha Udyog Ratnas (RURs) /Indian Industry /DPSUs /OFB/ Consortia on a level playing field', ' This procedure may also be followed for all upgradations of equipment/parts under the ‘Make’ category', ' Outsourcing of development of equipment /systems having high technology content should be considered on the lines of parallel development for which the cost should be shared with the vendor', '\\n\\nPrinciples and Policy\\n\\nGeneral Principles', ' Whilst it is not possible to lay down any rigid rules covering all the contingencies that may arise in the finalisation of specific development contracts, the following guiding principles may, however, be borne in mind :-\\n\\nExploration of sources for placement of development order should be as wide as possible, both in the public and private sector, to encourage competition', '\\n\\nAbility of the contractor to execute work of the desired quality to the required time schedule should be evaluated by a Technical Committee', '\\n\\nDevelopment contracts may, as far as feasible, be concluded with two or more contractors in parallel, subject to the other vendor/s agreeing to match the price of L1', ' In case of higher deviation the full / Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) order may be placed on the L1 firm, subject to price being found reasonable', '\\n\\nPlacing of parallel contracts on two parties is particularly necessary/desirable to have more than one source of supply at bulk production stage and also, apart from competition, to ensure successful completion of development if one of the contractors fails to develop the equipment in time', '\\n\\nThe ratio of splitting of the supply order between various development agencies/firms in cases of parallel development, including criteria thereof, must be pre-disclosed in the RFP itself', '\\n\\nHowever, in case the requirement is meager and complex technology is involved, a single source having expertise in the requisite field may be considered with appropriate justification and due approval of the CFA in consultation with IFA where required as per delegation of financial powers', '\\n\\n\\nThe contractor or the firm should be such that it can, if so desired, take up bulk production orders subsequently', '\\n\\nDuring the developmental stage, 20% of the total order quantity may be earmarked for development', ' This would, however, not be considered as a case of dual procurement', '\\n\\nThe information available with the DGS&D and the Defence Inspection Organisation (DGQA, DGNAI and DGAQA) may be availed of in selecting the firms to be entrusted with the development/fabrication contracts', '\\n\\nItems indented by the indenting authority through indents/Final Depot List/ Special Requisition should be the basis to proceed with the development after requisite quantity vetting has been done, as per laid down procedure', '\\n\\nProcessing of Development Orders', ' Some of the important steps involved in the processing of development contracts are as follows :-\\n\\nIdentification/Selection of stores/items for indigenous development', '\\n\\nGeneration of the Paper Particulars / drawings', '\\nIdentification of vendors/firms', '\\nFraming and Issue of RFP', '\\nTechnical evaluation of bids and holding of CNC/PNC', '\\nConclusion of Contract/ Supply Order', '\\nPost Contract Management', '\\n\\nSelection of Items for indigenization/development', ' The following broad guidelines may be adopted to arrive at the decision for indigenous development of items/equipment :-\\n\\nWhen OEM is closing down or has closed down the production line and spares are not available ex-import for equipment which has adequate residual life and population', '\\n\\nItems for which TOT has been taken', '\\n\\nItems including those which are low tech and the sample is available and which it would be economic to develop', '\\n\\n\\nSpares which are fast moving and the requirement is recurring in nature', '\\n\\nGoods for which the import price is exorbitant', '\\n\\nItems short-listed from MRLS and import list depending upon their criticality, technological processes involved and consumption rate', '\\n\\nWhere an Indian firm offers to develop an item on ‘No Cost : No Commitment’ basis', '\\n\\nIn special cases, where it is considered in the interest of the State to indigenize or for any other strategic reason to be recorded, e', 'g', ' Secrecy devices', '\\n\\n\\tDispensation to firms undertaking Development Contracts', ' The contract documents may be issued free of cost', ' Further, submission of earnest money deposit and security deposit may not be made mandatory in case of firms of repute/firms which are registered with DGS&D, DGQA/DGAQA or other Departments/Services on case to case basis', ' ', ' Development orders placed on firms may not have a liquidated damage clause, if it is found difficult to attract vendors to develop the item/ stores whose specification is normally not governed by any widely used standards like IS/BS, etc', '\\n\\n\\nPaper Particulars and Design Aspects\\n\\n  Model', ' Development contracts are generally of the following two types:-\\n\\nThose where industrial engineering of Prototype models is to be done by the firm on the complete design data which has already been evolved in the Establishment/Department by the design and development of an existing/original model', '\\n\\nThose where designing, developing and engineering are completely done by a firm under technical guidance and advice from the developmental authorities', ' In this case, it may be possible to utilize the expertise available in the industry and ensure quick and smooth supply', '\\n\\nDesign Aspects', ' In the case of contracts as at Para 15', '3', '1(a) above, the development contract would always be based on a draft technical / design specification and other information to be provided by the Establishment / Dte of Indigenisation/ Laboratory / Workshop / Depot', ' In\\n\\n\\ncase of contracts as at Para 15', '3', '1 (b) above, the contract should contain a provision for the development of industrially engineered models/equipment and supply of models/equipment at various stages with relevant types of drawing and other documents by the contractor, as required by the contracting authority', ' The design material, workmanship and performance of the equipment for a specific period should also be guaranteed by the contractor', '\\n\\nVendor Identification / Development\\n\\nIdentification of Vendors', ' Identification of appropriate vendors is a vital step and must be well considered', ' Wherever possible, the vendors who are registered with DGAQA/DGQA/DRDO/OFs/ DPSUs/Services indigenisation agencies/ NSIC should be approached', ' Suitable vendors can also be identified by the developing agency in consultation with other developing agencies apart from firms registered with DGQA or any other defence establishment', ' Unregistered firms may be considered taking into account their infrastructural facilities, capacity, technical competence and financial standing', ' A format for this purpose is enclosed at Form DPM - 5', ' Firms of national repute may also be considered based on self- certification, with the approval of the Defence Secretary', '\\n\\nDevelopment of Source by Inviting Applications for Enlistment', '\\n\\nThe following procedure will be followed:-\\n\\nOpen advertisement will be placed on the internet and advertised in leading newspapers every year, in respect of different products/components, for enlisting firms willing to participate in tenders issued by the Department/Organisation', ' The minimum number of products/components required to be submitted by the vendor for evaluation and likely demand for those products/components for the next two to three years will be indicated in the advertisement', '\\n\\nInterested firms may visit the factory/workshop/depot as indicated in the tender to see the product/ component required to be developed', ' Thereafter, the firms showing interest in developing the product/component should be asked to submit the details of infrastructure available with them, as per the documents prescribed for vendor registration;\\n\\nThe infrastructure details submitted by the firms should be studied by a team of officers constituted to assess their manufacturing capability to verify their genuine potential for developing the product/ component', '\\n\\n\\nFirms found capable of developing the product/component should be asked to submit the required number of samples (as advertised) of the identified product(s)', ' On acceptance of samples, the firm will be eligible for participating in the LTEs for the said component / product', '\\n\\nA firm may not be willing to submit a sample due to requirement of a heavy investment', ' In such cases, the indigenisation agency / Directorate may place a development order on the firm as follows :-\\n\\nThe cost of the sample will be assessed through a Board of Officers having representation from Finance', '\\n\\nThe firm will be asked to offer a quotation and if the price is found to be equal to or lower than the assessed cost, the development order will be placed on the firm at the price quoted', '\\n\\nIf the firm quotes a price higher than the assessed cost, the price will be negotiated with the firm and development order placed at the assessed cost', '\\n\\n\\tCapacity Assessment', ' Capacity assessment/verification of firms not registered with DGQA/DGNAI/DGAQA/Govt Agencies is to be undertaken by the developing agency by associating a member from the DGQA/DGNAI/DGAQA, other inspection agencies or other Technical Agencies/Committees on fast track to ensure that firms identified are capable to develop prototype equipment and systems as required', ' Where considered necessary by the CFA, IFA may be associated for assessment of the financial capacity of the firm', ' Once a firm has successfully executed an order within +/-5% tolerance both in terms of quality and quantity, it should be encouraged to get registered', '\\n\\nTransfer of Technology (ToT)', '    When equipment is being bought from a foreign vendor, the provision of ToT to an Indian private/public firm for providing maintenance infrastructure may be considered and the foreign vendor would need to identify an Indian firm which would be responsible for providing base repairs (third line) and the requisite spares for the entire life cycle of the equipment', ' These firms would be DPSUs/OFB/RURs/or any other firm specially selected for this purpose', ' In addition Army Base Workshops/Naval Dockyards/Base Repair Depots of Air Force may also be considered for this purpose at RFP stage on a case to case basis in consultation with the DDP', ' The RFP would spell out the specific requirements of ToT for Maintenance Infrastructure which could cover the production of certain spares, establishment of base repair facilities including testing facilities and the provision of spares for the entire life\\n\\n\\ncycle of the equipment', ' Both the foreign and the Indian firms would be jointly responsible for providing the maintenance facilities and support for that equipment', '\\n\\nFraming and Issue of RFP\\n\\nRequest for Proposal (RFP)', ' Development/ indigenisation of an item may require design, generation of drawings, manufacturing, development of prototype equipment and system, quality assurance during development process, tests and trials and inspections at various stages', ' RFP is to be floated to firms who have the required infrastructure for the proposed development', ' In order to save on development time and in case of the classified nature of stores to be developed, quotations may normally be invited on limited tender basis from firms/contractors who are known to be capable of undertaking the particular development work', ' However, depending upon the specific requirements of the case, the developing agency may justify issue of RFP either on OTE, LTE or STE basis, as required', '\\n\\nPre-bid Conference', ' In case of turnkey contracts or for development of sophisticated and complex equipment, a suitable provision is to be made in the bidding documents for a pre-bid conference for clarifying issues and clearing doubts, if any, about the specification and other technical details of the plant, machinery and equipment projected in the bidding document', ' The date, time and place of the Pre-bid Conference must be indicated in the bidding document and should be sufficiently ahead of the bid opening date', '\\n\\nReceipt and Evaluation of Bids\\n\\n\\tBid Opening/Technical Evaluation and CNC', ' The firms submitting their quotation will be intimated the place, date and time for opening of the quotation and the bids will be opened at the appointed time by the Board of Officers in the presence of the representatives of the firm, if present', ' The procedure for tender opening, technical evaluation, preparation of CST and convening of TPC/CNC for commercial evaluation thereof will be as per modality given elsewhere in the relevant Chapters of this DPM', '\\n\\n\\tResultant Single Vendor Situation', ' In case of LTE/Open Tender invitation if only one firm responds or if only one firm is found by the TEC to meet all the specifications, the following aspects will be examined:-\\n\\nWhether all necessary requirements such as Standard Tender Enquiry conditions, wide publicity, and sufficient time for formulation of tenders had been taken care of while issuing the RFP;\\n\\n\\nWhether the RFP was properly dispatched and duly received by the prospective vendors;\\n\\nWhether SQRs could be re-formulated to generate wider competition', '\\n\\nWhether\\tthe\\tprice\\tquoted\\tin\\tthe\\tbid\\tis\\tconsidered reasonable', '\\n\\n\\tExamination', ' If the examination reveals that requirements from (a) to (d) have been fulfilled the proposal may be processed further as a case of OTE/LTE as applicable, with the approval of the CFA, for placement of the development order', ' However, if the quoted price is not borne out as reasonable based on benchmarking prior to opening of the commercial bid or if the offer is not technically feasible or firm not considered capable of developing the item, the bid should be retracted with the approval of the CFA\\n\\n\\tReasonableness of Price', ' It would be mandatory for the vendor to submit the detailed break-up of cost under the headings materials (indigenous/ imported, quantity, cost), labour (number of man hours, man hour rates, etc', '), design and development, drawings and details of overheads which will be vetted by a technical team of the Department\\n/Organisation', ' The last purchase price (LPP) of imported item will be taken as the base price to arrive at the reasonableness of the quoted rates', ' In case LPP is not available the base price will be arrived at by the process of benchmarking which will be done prior to opening of the Commercial bid as per the procedure given in Chapter 13 of the DPM', ' L1 will be determined with reference to the development cost, including the cost of prototype and the total quantity for which the initial orders are placed', ' An indication of the quantities that would be required during the next two to three years should also be given in the RFP', '\\n\\nTYPES OF CONTRACTS\\n\\n\\tAdoption of Contract Type', ' Various types of contracts can   be adopted depending upon the nature, complexity and time span of the development work /project', ' These are described below', ' However, normally Firm-Fixed-Price contracts, Fixed Price Contracts with escalation clause and Fabrication Contracts will be concluded', ' Contracts other than these three will be adopted only with the prior approval of Service Headquarters/ Head of Organisation /Department /Service / HQ Maintenance Command IAF in consultation with the respective IFA', '\\n\\n\\n\\tFirm-Fixed-Price Contract', ' Firm fixed price contract means   a contract in which a lump sum amount is agreed upon for development/indigenisation and supply of the equipment based on data/specifications supplied and which is not subject to any adjustment during the performance of the contract due to any reasons whatsoever', ' The firm or the contractor assumes full financial responsibility in the form of profit or loss', ' This type of contract is best suited when reasonably definite design or performance specification is available and when Government can estimate reasonable price of development/indigenisation', '\\n\\n\\tFixed Price Contract with Escalation', ' This is the same as the firm- fixed-price contract, except that upward or downward revision of contracted price can be allowed on occurrence of certain contingencies beyond the control of the firm/contractor such as increase/decrease in wages or cost of material', ' An escalation formula must be included in such contracts and a ceiling of escalation should also be fixed in the case of long term contracts', ' Price variation clause can be provided only in long term contracts where the delivery period extends beyond 18 months', ' The conditions prescribed for price variation clause elsewhere in the DPM will apply whenever such a clause is included in the developmental contracts', '\\n\\nFixed Price Contract providing for Re-determination of Price', ' This type of contract is intended to eliminate the impact of contingencies due to causes other than those foreseen in the case of fixed price contract with escalation', ' These contingencies may be due to the contractor’s/firm’s unfamiliarity with the raw materials or manufacturing processes, to long term contracts, lack of specifications or the use of performance rather than product specifications', '   In such cases prospective re-determination could be done -\\n\\nOn request by either party\\nAt stated intervals\\nAt a determinable time', '\\n\\nFixed Price Incentive Contract', ' This type of contract is designed to provide a greater incentive to the firm / contractor to reduce the contract costs by providing higher profits if costs are reduced and lower profits when costs rise', ' These costs, the ceilings on target cost, target profit, a price ceiling and the formula for arriving at final cost are all settled before the execution of the contract', ' This contract type will only be applicable for ab-initio development contracts', '\\n\\nCost Plus Contract', ' Cost Plus contracts should ordinarily be avoided', ' Where such contracts become unavoidable as no vendor is willing to undertake the development, full justification should be recorded before\\n\\n\\nentering into the contract', ' In this type of contract the firm/contractor is reimbursed the costs incurred and also receives a negotiated profit for performing the contract, i', 'e', ', the profit of the firm/contractor and not the cost of development is fixed', ' Contractor’s responsibility towards cost of the item is minimum except that he has to use the same care and prudence as is expected under fixed price contracts', ' This type of contract should be concluded only when the uncertainty which is involved in the contract performance is of such a magnitude that the cost of performance cannot be estimated with sufficient reasonableness to permit the type of fixed price contract', ' It is also necessary to ascertain that the firms/contractors have cost accounting machinery and that the cost is clearly defined', ' A strict R&D surveillance has got to be provided by the Dept to ensure that costs incurred by the firm are reduced to the minimum', ' The RFP should provide for the firm’s books of accounts to be checked by the Order Placing Agency to verify the costs by inclusion of a book examination clause as per standard format', ' Where supplies or works have to continue over a long duration, efforts should be made to convert future contracts on a firm price basis, after allowing a reasonable period to the supplier/contractor to stabilise their production methods', '\\n\\n\\tFabrication Contract', ' Fabrication contract means a one time contract concluded with a contractor or a firm for fabrication and supply of component, sub-assemblies or an assembly, which are not commercially available, against design drawings/specifications to be supplied by the Directorate of Indigenisation/R&D Laboratory/Establishment/Workshop/ Depot /Institution', '\\n\\nConclusion of Development Contracts\\n\\n\\tConditions for placing Development Contracts', '   The following points will be borne in mind by the authority entering into a contract :-\\n\\nContracts in writing should be placed after calling for quotations from a number of firms/contractors unless STE is resorted to for which detailed justification would be necessary', ' The two bid system should be followed in design/development/fabrication contracts of a complex nature', ' In other cases, a single bid may be invited', ' A Pre bid conference may be held prior to submission of the tenders to clarify any doubtful areas and also to firm up the SQRs/QRs prior to submission of bids', '\\n\\nWhen the statement of case for sanctioning of various phases of the project or the indent is put up, the Head of Service or Establishment /Director/Purchase Dept concerned should mention the amount that is intended to be spent on development/fabrication contracts out of the total cost of the project', ' At this stage detailed\\n\\n\\nparticulars regarding the inquiries made with firms, if any, the number of prototypes intended for manufacture and the intention to get the prototype manufactured by one or more firms must be mentioned', '\\n\\nThe financial status and technical capability verification reports as well as compliance with the techno commercial requirements will be taken into account at the TEC stage itself', ' ‘Q’ bids of only those firms will be opened who are cleared by the TEC', '\\n\\nOrdinarily advance payments need not be agreed to in the payment terms', ' If, however, advance payments have to be made, these should be made against a Bank Guarantee executed on proper stamp paper', ' If stage payments are to be made to the firm/contractor, the stages should be clearly defined and it should be ensured that the payments are in consonance with the work actually performed by the firm/contractor as per each stage, viz', ' Preliminary, Design Review, Detailed Design Review and Realisation of Prototype', ' The quantum of payment will generally not exceed 50% of the estimated expenditure incurred by the contractor upto that stage', ' The yardsticks for work measurement will be laid down in the contract', '\\n\\nOnce a contract has been concluded, the terms and conditions thereof will generally not be varied', ' However where this becomes necessary/inescapable any modification will be carried out with the prior concurrence of the appropriate CFA and the respective IFA, within whose powers the revised contract value falls', '\\n\\nWhenever stores are required to be issued to the firm/contractor for fabrication or prototypes or sub-assemblies are issued for guidance in fabrication, these should be issued against appropriate Bank Guarantee', ' In addition to the Bank Guarantee, appropriate insurance may be asked only where it is considered necessary', '\\n\\n\\tStandard and Special Conditions', ' Standard conditions, as in Part III of Appendix ‘C’, which are applicable to the contract will only be given to the contractor Any special conditions of contract considered necessary shall also be drawn out by the Establishment/ Indigenisation Directorate / Laboratory / Developing agency/Department concerned and issued to the tenderers along with other documents', ' The successful bidder will conclude an Agreement as per the draft at Appendix I', '\\n\\n\\nFabrication Contracts', ' The acceptance of quotation in this case would take the form of a supply order', ' Format given in Appendix J for fabrication orders will be annexed thereto', '\\n\\nPlacement of Order\\n\\n\\tIn case of items considered economically viable for indigenous development, the first order may be placed for the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) only, The balance number of items in the indent over and above the EOQ may be returned to the indenter and the latter may be asked to re-certify the funds for the EOQ only', ' The indenter may obtain his balance requirement, if any through import route or through any other sources', ' Generally a period of two to three years may be provided for indigenous development of a defence item', '\\n\\n\\tIn case the quantity of the equipment/ spares is limited/small and may become uneconomic (Non - EOQ) if distributed between two vendors, the entire order would be placed upon the L1 vendor only', '\\n\\n\\tIf the indented quantity is found to be less than the assessed EOQ, the Indigenization Agency should first float the RFP and in case there is no response, it will not be taken up for indigenization unless its’ development is considered essential for strategic reasons', '\\n\\nDevelopment of Second/New Sources\\n\\nProcedure', ' With a view to speeding up development of additional indigenous sources, the question of earmarking a prescribed quantity of the indent for developing a new source has been considered, and the following procedure may be adopted for procurement of items of a development nature, particularly for high value indents of Rs 10 Crs and above:-\\n\\nWhere there is only a single developed source, or where there is a felt need for development of more than two sources, 20% only of the second indent should be earmarked for placement as an educational order on the new source to be developed', ' The percentage may however be modified to ensure that the quantity covered is viable for economic production', ' This order for the earmarked 20 % should be placed by inviting tenders (OTE/LTE) as per the normal procedure laid down, and the source already developed will not participate in this', '\\n\\nThe balance 80% of the indent is to be procured from the sources already developed', ' The firms that execute the source development orders within 5% tolerance clause will be considered\\n\\n\\nas established source subject to submission of bid for at least 50% quantity of the source development tender', '\\n\\nPending successful development of a new source, the order should be placed on the developed source(s) for the required quantity as indented by the Services by following the usual procedure laid down in this regard in order to ensure that the requirement of Services and of Production are met fully and without any delay', '\\n\\nIn case the new source on which the order for 20% of the indent was placed fails to develop the item, the order should be placed on another new source to be selected by following the usual procedure laid down', '\\n\\nA second order to an undeveloped source which has secured one order will not be issued unless:-\\n\\nA\\tBulk\\tProduction\\tClearance\\t(BPC)\\thas\\tbeen accorded to it for the subject item against the first order; and\\n\\nIt has made at least 50% of the supplies of the first Supply Order placed on it, which have been duly accepted', '\\n\\nAcquiring Manufacturing Drawings In order to rapidly develop alternative sources of supply of an item after this has been developed and productionised by one contractor, it is essential that the manufacturing drawings are passed on by the contractor to the Govt', ' Since the manufacturing drawings are evolved and finalised by the contractor who has initially developed the item, it is likely that the contractor would claim his rights on such drawings and not agree to part with them', ' Accordingly, a clause should be included in the Tender Enquiry clarifying that the manufacturing drawings /tools/ jigs/ fixtures / dyes/moulds prepared by the contractor for manufacture of the store required shall be the property of the Ministry of Defence and as such shall be passed on to the Purchaser and shall not be used by the contractor for any purpose other than this contract, without the written consent of the Competent Financial Authority, in consultation with the IFA', '\\n\\n Items Developed by Defence PSUs/OFB', ' The cases in   which DRDO/ Defence PSUs/OFB /RURs have successfully developed an item for the Deptt of Defence or have taken Transfer of Technology (ToT) for Department of Defence would not be taken as single vendor cases and only a commercial RFP should be issued to them directly', ' Instead, they would be treated at par with the proprietary firms for any subsequent procurement, except that no PAC certificate is required', ' Further, the delegated financial powers of CFAs for PAC purchases will be exercised\\n\\n\\nfor such procurements', ' It will, however, be checked prior to placing of orders that the technology absorption levels agreed to while concluding the ToT contract have been achieved', '\\n\\nTerms of Payment\\n\\nGeneral ', ' The normal terms of payment are 100% payment within 30 days time after receipt and acceptance of the materials in good condition or the date of receipt of supplier’s bill, whichever is later', ' However, an amount of 10% may be withheld as performance guarantee (where Security Deposit has not been taken) during the warranty period as mutually agreed with the contractor', '\\n\\nOptional', ' Alternatively, payment upto 90% against proof of dispatch taking into consideration aspects like the reputation and past performance of the suppliers and pre-inspection of the goods at the suppliers’ premises may be considered where necessary', ' Such payments for dispatch by road will be made only if the goods are at suppliers’ cost', '\\n\\nAdvance Payment to Suppliers', '    Generally no advance should be paid to the firms/contractors and payments for services rendered or supplies made should be released only after the services have been rendered or supplies made', ' However, it may become necessary in the case of development and fabrication contracts or in case of turnkey projects to give an advance', ' In such cases it should be ensured that only a minimum reasonable amount, upto 15%, is given as advance at the time of placement of the order', ' Such advance payments will be made only against furnishing of a proper bank guarantee by the firm from a public sector bank or private sector bank duly authorized by RBI to handle Government transactions', ' Format for the Bank Guarantee is given in Form DPM-16', '\\n\\nIntermediate Payments', ' The initial advance paid should be adjusted against the successive stage payments due to the supplier', ' The intermediary payments, if any, should be spread over the period of execution of the projects/contract and made in suitable installments keeping in view various stages of development/manufacture', ' These stages should be pre-determined and it should be ensured that the payments made are in consonance with work actually performed by the firm/contractor and linked to verifiable milestones viz', ' Preliminary Design Review, Detailed Design Review, purchase of raw materials and realisation of prototype etc', ' The quantum of payment will generally not exceed 50% of the estimated expenditure incurred by the contractor upto that stage', ' About 20 to 25% amount as last installment should be released only after the completion of the project or rendering of the services/supplies to the entire satisfaction of the authority placing the order', '\\n\\n\\n\\nDeviations', ' Cases of advance payment over and above the limits prescribed above would require the approval of the Defence Secretary and concurrence of FA (DS)/Secy Def (Finance)', '\\n\\nPost Contract Management\\n\\nForwarding of Contract Documents', 'Once a project has been sanctioned and a contract is concluded for development/fabrication, a copy of the contract will be forwarded to the Heads of Technical Directorates/Services at Headquarters / AHSP', ' Two copies of the contract (one for the CDA and the other for the LAO concerned) will be forwarded to CDA and IFA concerned for such action as may be considered necessary by them', '\\n\\nResponsibility for Technical Matters', ' The responsibility in technical matters relating to the development shall rest with the Head of the Service/ Establishment / Directorate of Indigenisation / Laboratory/ Workshop / Depot / Institution concerned', '\\n\\nInspections', ' There may be two to three inspections during the development stage and firms may be made more accountable for their product', ' They may be asked to furnish reports of various tests from the various laboratories as required by the Purchaser, The requirements are to be indicated in the approved Quality Assurance Plan (QAP)', ' A clause should be provided that in case it is subsequently found that the firm has used fraudulent means to obtain the report/s and the item developed is not as per specifications indicated in the RFP the firm will be blacklisted for a minimum period of three years from any future tender', ' Once an item has been declared as free flow, for further procurement the inspection will be done by the DGQA/DGAQA as per normal procedure', '\\n\\nMonitoring Progress', ' Responsibility to monitor the progress and operation of the Development/Fabrication contract will rest with the authority that has entered into such contract', ' The customer will provide necessary guidance to the firm as required from time to time and will maintain close liaison with them to clarify any doubts', ' The progress of development will be monitored closely and in case the progress is not found to be satisfactory, suitable action will be taken as provided for in the contract', '\\n\\nReturn of Documents', ' Documents, specifications, drawings issued to the firms/contractors or prepared by them should be taken over as these belong to the Govt', ' A provision to this effect should be made in the contracts', ' Loss or damage to these documents shall be recoverable from the contractors', '\\n\\n\\nDeclaration of Free Flow\\n\\nDeclaration of Item as Developed', ' The indigenization of an item will be considered complete and the item declared as free flow under the following conditions-\\n\\nWhen the initial quantity is not large enough to be split and/or the equipment/ system / item is a high tech complex one requiring substantial investment even at the time of development in terms of plant and machinery, the development of a single source and successful delivery against the order placed may be considered sufficient to declare the item as developed', '\\n\\nIn all other cases, when at least one successful purchase is made and at least two sources are fully established, which would not only ensure price competition but also avert Government’s dependence on any single source', '\\n\\nCompletion of codification of the item / equipment by the AHSP (applicable in all cases)', '\\n\\nIf a second source for the item is not developed under clause at serial (b) above within five years from the date of completion of the first supply order, the item may be declared as “free flow” i', 'e as developed thereafter; however, there could be exceptions with full justification where an item is declared free flow even earlier', '\\n\\nBulk Production by Agencies associated with Development', ' After the item has been declared as developed, the first bulk order will be placed on the production agency / agencies associated with the HQrs/Department in the development of the item and the following procedure will be adopted for this purpose:-\\n\\nThere should be a reservation of quantity not exceeding 50% of the initial order quantity for production agency (ies) associated with the development of the product', '\\n\\nWhere the initial quantity is not large enough to be split and / or the item is a high-tech one, requiring substantial investment even at the time of development in terms of plant and machinery, the ordered quantity shall be covered on such production agency (ies)', '\\n\\nIn the case of (a) above, the price will be settled on the basis of competitive quotations by issuing a tender enquiry to other agencies who, though not associated with the development of the product, are considered competent to productionise the item', ' In\\n\\n\\nsuch a case if the production agency associated with the development of the product quotes a price higher than the lowest acceptable offer, such agency shall be asked to match the lowest price, failing which they can be considered, for a price preference not exceeding over the lowest acceptable offer', '\\n\\nIn the case of (b) above, the quotations would be obtained only from the production agency associated with the development and price will be settled through a study of the various elements of cost, the data for which will be furnished by the concerned agency', '\\n\\nThe dispensation as indicated above shall be given to the production agency associated with the development only where their association is with regard to the development of an item which can be separately procured', '\\n\\nEven in case the source is not already registered, the latest bulk order can be placed on them', ' However, their continuance as an established supplier of the item will be subject to their capacity verification and registration by the competent authority/ Department', '\\n\\nApplicability of Other Chapters All design, indigenous development, indigenisation and fabrication contracts will be processed as per the provisions and procedures given in this Chapter', ' The policy, procedures and provisions contained elsewhere in the DPM would be applicable to Design, Development, Indigenisation and Fabrication Contracts only to the extent the subject is not specifically covered in this Chapter', '\\n\\n\\n*********\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

VAT is intended as extra, over the quoted prices, the Bidder must specifically say so', ' In the absence of any such stipulation it will be\\n\\n\\npresumed that the prices quoted are firm and final and no claim on account of such duties will be entrained after the opening of tenders', ' If a Bidder chooses to quote a price inclusive of any duty and does not confirm inclusive of such duty so included is firm and final, he should clearly indicate the rate of such duty and quantum of excise duty included in the price', ' Failure to do so may result in ignoring of such offers summarily', '

excise duty was presently not applicable but the same will be charged if it becomes leviable later on, will not be accepted unless in such cases it is clearly stated by a Bidder that excise duty will not be charged by him even if the same becomes applicable later on', ' In respect of the Bidders who fail to comply with this requirement, their quoted prices shall be loaded with the quantum of excise duty which is normally applicable on the item in question for the purpose of comparing their prices with other Bidders', ' The same logic applies to Customs duty and VAT also', '\\n\\nIn import cases, all the foreign quotes will be brought to a common denomination in Indian Rupees by adopting the exchange rate as BC Selling rate of the State Bank of India on the date of the opening of Price Bids', '\\n\\nIf there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price that is obtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, the unit price will prevail and the total price will be corrected', ' If there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words will prevail for calculation of price', '\\n\\nThe Buyer reserves the right to evaluate the offers received by using Discounted Cash Flow method at a discounting rate of\\t%', ' In case cash flow involves more than one currency, the same will be brought to a common denomination in Indian Rupees by adopting exchange rate as BC Selling rate of the State Bank of India on the date of the opening of Price Bids', '\\n\\nThe Lowest Acceptable Bid will be considered further for placement of contract / Supply Order after complete clarification and price negotiations as decided by the Buyer', ' The Buyer will have the right to award contracts to different Bidders for being lowest in particular items', ' The

clause has to be provided for services (with insignificant inputs of materials) as for example, in getting Technical Assistance normally paid in the form of per diem rates, the price variation formula should have only two elements, viz', ' a high fixed element and a labour element', ' The fixed element can in such cases be 50% or more, depending on the mark-up by the supplier of the Per Diem rate vis-a-vis the wage rates', '\\n\\nFollowing conditions would be applicable to Price Adjustment –\\nBase dates shall be due dates of opening of price bids', '\\nDate of adjustment shall be mid point of
